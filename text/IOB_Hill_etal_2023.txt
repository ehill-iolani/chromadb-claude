Abstract
Studies of the Papuan region have provided fundamental insights into the evolutionary processes generating its exceptional
biodiversity, but the influence of geological processes merits further study. Lying at the junction of five tectonic plates,
this region has experienced a turbulent geological history that has not only produced towering mountains allowing
elevational specialization, and island archipelagos with varying degrees of isolation promoting vicariance, but also active
margins where land masses have collided and been subsequently rifted apart creating a mosaic of intermixed terranes with
vastly different geological histories. Asterophryine frogs are a hyperdiverse clade representing half the world’s microhylid
diversity (over 360 species) centered on New Guinea and its satellite islands. We show that vicariance facilitated by
geological history explains this far and wide distribution of a clade that should have poor dispersal abilities. We recovered
a mainland tectonic unit, the East Papua Composite Terrane (EPCT), as the center of origin for Asterophryinae and no
fewer than 71 instances of what appear to be long-distance dispersal events, 29 of which are between mainland regions,
with 42 from the mainland to the islands, some presently as far as 200 km away from source populations over open ocean.
Furthermore, we find strong support for a ”Slow and Steady” hypothesis for the formation of the northern margin of
New Guinea by many separate accretion events during the Miocene, over other major geological alternatives, consistent
with the 20 M year age of the clade and arrival via the EPCT. In addition, the historical biogeography of our frogs
strongly supports an affiliation of the Louisiade Archipelago and Woodlark Island with the Owen Stanley Range on the
EPCT, and the recent proximity of the large New Britain Island. Our results show that Asterophryinae did not have to
repeatedly and independently disperse across large ocean barriers to the offshore islands, against the predictions of island
biogeography theory, but that the current distribution can be explained through vicariance and short-distance oceanic
dispersal as historical land connections disappeared and islands slowly became separated from each other. We show that
islands have a life history, changing in distance from other land masses, with consequent opportunities for dispersal,
isolation, and cladogenesis of their biotas. More broadly, we can begin to see how the geological history of the Papuan
region can result in the rapid accumulation and staggering number of extant species.

Wallace (1876, 1880) proposed that to understand the
fascinating distributional patterns in the South Pacific requires
a consideration of both natural selection and earth history
(Hazzi et al., 2018; Pellissier et al., 2018). The island of NewGuinea hosts staggering biodiversity, containing among the
highest degrees of endemism of any place on earth (Allison,
2009; Brooks et al., 2006; Gressitt, 1982) and provides a
case in point, lying in an intersection zone between Asian
and Australian faunas that coincides with tectonic provinces
between the two areas. Wallace’s second proposal, that a
changing geology may shape the distribution and diversity
of life, is supported by correlation between geological events
and areas of high species richness. The rise of the central
high mountains is associated with vicariance in ants (Li and

Li, 2018) and freshwater turtles (Georges et al., 2014), and
signatures of presumed island fragmentation and accretion
sequences are reflected in patterns of endemism in island
insects (Boer and Duffels, 1996; Polhemus, 1996; Polhemus
and Polhemus, 1998). Recent advances in phylogenetic methods
incorporating timing informed by new geological data for New
Guinea (reviewed in: Baldwin et al., 2012) have inspired
more explicit spatio-temporal hypotheses of distribution and
diversity (e.g., Jonsson et al., 2011; Georges et al., 2014;
Toussaint et al., 2014). Toussaint et al. (2014) found support
for recent orogeny driving the diversification of montane
arthropods, supporting the geological model of Hall (1998,
2002) which posits that collision between the Pacific and
Australian plates resulted in uplift of the central cordillera
and the rest of mainland New Guinea. We call this model
“recent emergence” as it predicts that as late as ( ∼5Ma), most
of New Guinea was under water with only the central high
mountains above sea level and available for colonization by
terrestrial taxa. While this model explains diversity patterns
of young taxa centered on the central cordillera, there are both
additional major biogeographical patterns as well as alternative
hypotheses of geological history which make different spatio-
temporal predictions. More generally, biological data has the
– thus far mostly untapped – potential to inform competing
geological hypotheses, but what is required is consideration of
alternative geological hypotheses that are tested with clades
that are older and more widely distributed across New Guinea
(but see: Cozzarolo et al., 2019).
New Guinea lies in one of the most tectonically active
regions of the world, and while its geological history is complex,
it is generally accepted that that the formation of the island
involves the collision of multiple plates and accretion of multiple
island arcs (reviewed in: Baldwin et al., 2012). Starting
along the northern edge of the Australian Craton, the island
formed over the Cenozoic with the additions of the East Papua
Composite Terrane, the Fold Belt, the Accreted Terranes,
and the Vogelkop Peninsula (Baldwin et al., 2012; Crowhurst
et al., 1996; Davies et al., 1996, 1997; Dow, 1977; Pigram and
Davies, 1987; Pigram and Symond, 1991; Hall, 2002; Holm
et al., 2019; Quarles van Ufford and Cloos, 2005; Webb et al.,
2014). These processes were initiated by the collision of the
northward-moving Australian Plate with the west-northwest-
moving Pacific Plate, with the additional interactions of the
smaller Philippine, Caroline, and Solomon Sea plates (Hall,
1998; Klootwijk et al., 2003; Kroenke et al., 1984; Kroenke,
1996), and various other microplates that were shattered
off along their edges during convergence. This resulted in
sequential accretion of island arcs and subduction or obduction
of oceanic and continental crust (Polhemus, 2007; Baldwin
et al., 2012), to form an island of large size and complex
topography, as well as a specific temporal ordering of land
connections. The last major addition occurred within the last
several million years, involving the rotation and subduction of
the South Bismarck Plate at the northern margin to form the
most recent component of the Accreted Terranes, adding the
Adelbert-Finnisterre terrane containing the Huon Peninsula,
and bringing the New Britain Island arc into the closest
proximity to the mainland that it has ever been (Baldwin et al.,
2012).
In addition to the “recent emergence” hypothesis, two
additional geological hypotheses have particular relevance for
biotic diversification and differ with regard to the timing and
assembly of the northern coastal terranes. The “Mobile Belt”
hypothesis posits that the Accreted Terranes were assembledoffshore into a single unit during the Late Oligocene (25-23
Ma), and subsequently docked onto the growing mainland in
the mid-Miocene (15-11 Ma; Dow, 1972, 1977; Davies, 2012)
giving rapid rise to the central high mountains in the Fold Belt
(Quarles van Ufford and Cloos, 2005; Webb et al., 2014; Holm
et al., 2019). Alternatively, several authors hypothesize that
accretion along the northern coast has been a “slow and steady”
process extending from the Late Cretaceous to the Pleistocene
(Pigram and Davies, 1987; Davies et al., 1996; Quarles van
Ufford and Cloos, 2005). Under this scenario, the ECPT is a
composite of terranes which accreted onto a displaced sliver
of the Australian Craton beginning with an arc collision in
the Paleocene/Eocene, and then suturing to the main body of
New Guinea in the Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene (30-25
Ma, Davies et al., 1997), while the addition of the Accreted
Terranes in the northern part of main New Guinea began in the
Paleocene in the west (68 Ma) and extended until the Pliocene
(5-2 Ma) in the east, the most recent ongoing addition being
portions of the New Britain Island arc. The orogeny of the
central high mountains is proposed to have occurred in the mid-
Miocene (15-11 Ma), together with docking of the Vogelkop
Peninsula in the west (Pigram and Davies, 1987; Polhemus and
Polhemus, 1998; Quarles van Ufford and Cloos, 2005; Davies,
2012), although Holm et al. (2019) hypothesize that Vogelkop
sutured onto the western edge of New Guinea more recently, in
the Late Miocene (7-3 Ma). Each of these geological models
provides very different spatio-temporal implications for the
evolution of biodiversity.
Frogs of the subfamily Asterophryinae are a particularly
appropriate group to study the role of geologic history
on distribution and diversification. Nearly 700 species of
microhylid frogs are distributed worldwide across the Americas,
Africa, Asia, and Australia (AmphibiaWeb, 2020), but half
of them – over 360 recognized species – comprise its largest
subfamily, Asterophryinae, which are centered in the Papuan
region (New Guinea and its satellite islands, and the Bismarck
and Louisiade Archipelagos), and extend into Malaysia, the
Philippines, the northeastern coast of Australia, and have
recently been described from Thailand and Vietnam (Poyarkov
et al., 2018; Suwannapoom et al., 2018). Recent molecular
studies indicate they arose during the Miocene, within the
past∼20 MY (Feng et al., 2017; Hill et al., 2022), coincident
with major geological development of New Guinea. High
generic diversity (17 recognized genera) and endemism of
Asterophryinae relative to the other four native anuran families
in New Guinea suggest they were probably the first frog
lineage to colonize the region (Van Bocxlaer et al., 2006;
Frost et al., 2006; K¨ ohler and G¨ unther, 2008; van der Meijden
et al., 2007; Savage, 1973; Rivera et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2018;
Hill et al., 2022). Anurans are poor oceanic dispersers, yet a
substantial number of species occurring on the offshore islands
have deeply divergent sister taxon relationships with lineages on
the New Guinea mainland (Hill et al., 2022), suggesting either
long-distance overwater dispersal or past geologic connection
between land masses.
In this study, we reconstruct the biogeographic history of
Asterophryinae using a densely sampled phylogeny coupled
with sophisticated evolutionary analyses to test geological
hypotheses for diversification. We construct alternative
geological hypotheses for (i) slow and steady accumulation of
the Accreted and East Papua Composite Terranes, (ii) offshore
Mobile Belt formation, (iii) recent emergence of New Guinea,
and (iv) development of the offshore islands which have received
little geological study, and allow these hypotheses to competeMovement of frogs or movement of land? 3
for the best explanation of range evolution. We infer ancestral
ranges and the minimum number of dispersal events to explain
the biogeographic distribution of the clade.
Materials and Methods
Taxonomic and Geographic Sampling
The subfamily Asterophryinae is distributed across the
Southwest Pacific (Fig. 1, IUCN, 2022). Over 90% of
the diversity of Asterophryinae (327 species out of 363
named species) is endemic to the Papuan region including
New Guinea Island and several of its satellite islands (the
D’Entrecasteaux Islands, other small satellite islands, and
the Louisiade Archipelago), with a few species occurring
along the northern coast of Australia, in the Philippines,
and in Indochina from Vietnam and Thailand southward into
Malaysia. Asterophryines were almost certainly the first anuran
lineage to colonize New Guinea as they are the dominant
anuran fauna of New Guinea Island (especially concentrated
along the northern coast of New Guinea) and several of its
satellite islands, whereas they represent only minor portions
of the anuran fauna in Asia and Australia.
For our biogeographical analysis we used our previously
published dataset (Hill et al., 2022, 2023), which contains 218
samples from over 80 sites across Papua New Guinea and its
satellite islands (Fig. 2), spanning a majority of the geographic
extent of Asterophryinae, and reasonably representing the
known geographic diversity (Fig. 1). Importantly, this
geographic sampling includes all five tectonic sectors of
mainland New Guinea as well as the majority of taxa
from several satellite islands where Asterophryinae diversity
is high (Normanby and Fergusson of the D’Entrecasteux
Islands, Misima, Rossel, and Sudest Islands of the Louisiade
Archipelago, Woodlark Island, and New Britain Island), with
two samples each from the Philippines and Sulawesi, Indonesia.
We used the time-calibrated Asterophryinae phylogeny of
Hill et al. (2022, 2023), which contains 218 tips and is the
largest and most comprehensive phylogenetic effort for this
subfamily to date. Time-calibration was made using widely-
agreed upon geological references, specifically the isolation of
the islands that form the Louisiade Archipelago (6-4 Ma) and
the opening of the Woodlark Basin (6-5 Ma, Hill et al., 1992;
Davies et al., 1997; Baldwin et al., 2012; Wallace et al., 2014;
Webb et al., 2014). See Hill et al. (2022) and Rivera et al. (2017)
for further explanation. Although no fossil data are available
for Asterophryinae, the age of the tree is corroborated by the
independent analysis of Feng et al. (2017), who recovered a 20
M year old age estimate for Asterophryinae using 20 fossil age
constraints from older amphibian groups.
This taxonomic sampling includes 205 taxa, 122 named
species and an additional 83 putative taxa, and importantly
includes robust sampling across all known genera (16
monophyletic genera and two historically recognized genera
whose monophyly remains unconfirmed). We note that while
Asterophryinae taxonomy is much improved based on recent
molecular studies (K¨ ohler and G¨ unther, 2008; van der Meijden
et al., 2007; de Sa et al., 2012; Peloso et al., 2016; Rivera
et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2018; Hill et al., 2022, 2023), the
taxonomy is incomplete and complicated by a large number
of undescribed species (a rough estimate is approximately 40%
of collections are undescribed), as well as what is sure to beextensive undiscovered diversity (many recent studies report
cryptic diversity across many lineages).
Our overall sampling strategy was to include as many
geographically and taxonomically representative samples as
we could obtain from our field studies spanning several
decades along with contributions from colleagues (see
acknowledgements in: Hill et al., 2022, 2023). Furthermore,
we note that New Guinea Island contains two countries, and
fieldwork has been more extensive in Papua New Guinea due to
the logistical and political difficulties of working in Indonesia.
Therefore, the full extent of Asterophryinae diversity is not
completely known. However, this dataset contains the largest
geographic and taxonomic sampling of the known distribution
of Asterophryinae of the Papuan Region.
The geographical sampling includes 13 georegions used to
test hypotheses of historical phylogeography: all five recognized
major tectonic units of mainland Papua New Guinea: the East
Papua Composite Terrane (E), the Fold Belt (F), the Australian
Craton (A), the Accreted Terranes (A), and the Vogelkop
Peninsula (V); seven offshore islands including New Britain
Island (B), Misima Island (M), Sudest Island (S), Rossel Island
(R), Normanby Island (Y), Fergusson Island (G), Woodlark
Island (W); and Southeast Asia (N). Seventeen sites are located
on offshore islands with the remaining 63 occurring on the
Papuan mainland. A summary of the number of species and
sites per georegion are listed in Table 1, with metadata for
all samples including GPS coordinates provided in Table 1
of Hill et al. (2023). We focused our geological exploration
on alternative hypotheses of shared geohistory among these
regions.
Modeling the Evolution of Geographic Range
We modeled the evolution of geographic ranges of
Asterophryinae using dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis models
(DEC Ree et al., 2005; Ree and Smith, 2008), using the
Bayesian implementation provided by Matzke (2014). These
biogeographic models are described in detail in Ree et al. (2005)
and Ree and Smith (2008), but we briefly review the key
components here to explain our hypothesis testing approach
which required representing differences in dispersal opportunity
afforded by the alternate geological scenarios. We use “areas” to

refer to distinct georegions observed in our dataset, and “range”
as the set of areas occupied by a lineage, thus areas are fixed but
species ranges can evolve through time. DEC models describe
an evolutionary process for biogeographic range evolution along
a phylogeny (Ree et al., 2005; Ree and Smith, 2008), and
are closely related to stochastic models for discrete character
evolution, but importantly differ in breaking up each state
change into two possible stochastic events: dispersal to a new
area, and extinction from an existing area. Discrete changes
from one state to another are assumed to occur randomly with
respect to time according to a Markov process with probability
matrix Pij(t) from ancestor state ito descendant state j. In
matrix form this equation is:
P(t) =e−Q(t)
Where Qis the instantaneous rate matrix containing
both the rates of dispersal Dijbetween ancestor range ito
descendant range j, and rates of local extinction Ei. For
example, for three areas (1, 2, 3, along with the null area
∅for the possibility of extinction), and with each lineage
occupying a maximum of two areas, the possible ranges would
be enumerated as S={∅,1,2,3,12,13,23}, and Qwould be
parameterized as:Q=∅ 1 2 3 12 13 23

13 0 E30E10− 0
23 0 0 E3E20 0 −
Thus, a frog lineage may expand its range by dispersal into
a new area, contract its range when extinction occurs from
part of its range, or may change areas if both dispersal to
the new and extinction from the old areas occur jointly. These
equations model state changes along branches, with nodes
assumed to represent speciation events. As the phylogeny is
assumed to be true (as with many phylogenetic comparative
methods), all possible state combinations at internal nodes
compatible with the observed ranges at the tips are integrated
over in computing a likelihood for the model. The model
outputs include maximum likelihood estimates for the dispersal
and extinction rates and inferred ancestral ranges at the
nodes. DEC models are flexible enough to allow a variety of
evolutionary outcomes, including rapid spread as well as slow
biogeographical evolution across a landscape, as one would
expect for lineages that are poor dispersers such as frogs, as
opposed to free movement from anywhere to anywhere as would
be allowed for standard discrete character models.Movement of frogs or movement of land? 5

Fig. 2. Five major geological regions of NG that illustrate accretion history. The island of New Guinea has a composite history with multiple
geologic terranes alagamating to form the large island. The geologic terranes of New Guinea are labeled following Davies (2012): the East
Papua Composite Terrane, the Accreted Terranes, the Fold Belt, the Australian Craton and the Vogelkop Peninsula. Sampling sites across
PNG and satellite islands are indicated by numbers, with insets showing detail for sites that are clustered. Site names, GPS coordinates,
and metadata are provided in Table 1 of Hill et al. (2023).
We focus on testing alternative geological hypotheses
that explain the dispersal history of our frogs, implemented
by adding constraints that represent hypothetical dispersal
barriers. We used the dispersal multipliers matrix in
BioGeoBears (Matzke, 2014), with “1”s indicating each pair
of areas where dispersal is allowed, and “0”s for each pair of
areas where dispersal is highly unlikely, as may occur between
islands separated by open ocean (we note in practice, the
zeros are instead “0.001”s, a small number for the software
to return a model fit). The dispersal elements of the Q matrix
are multiplied by these constraints, influencing which dispersal
paths dominate in the explanation of the data.
We used dispersal multiplier matrices with either pairwise
connections or multiway connections to represent our geological
scenarios. In particular, New Guinea Island was formed by
terranes docking or accreting onto existing terranes along
particular margins, which was modeled with a pairwise
connection matrix, with the EPCT connected to the Accreted
Terranes and the Fold Belt with 1s (brown bars indicating
connections in Fig. 3), but not the Australian Craton nor the
Vogelkop Peninsula (0s). We note that it is possible for EPCT
lineages to reach the Vogelkop, but would require an additional
step through the Accreted Terranes, for example, to create a
connected path consistent with the difficulty of long-distance
dispersal in this system. Alternatively, we have archipelagos
which may have been connected at one time, or a hypothesisof islands rifting off from a mainland origin, such as for the
Louisiade Archipelago which is hypothesized to have originated
as a southeastern extension of the Owen Stanley Range of the
EPCT prior to its current state as a set of separate oceanic
islands. This hypothesis is represented by all members of the
affected islands and the EPCT connected by “1”s to each other,
forming a block of multi-way connections (light purple areas of
connection in Fig. 3).
For example, hypothesis a, Naive Geohistory, in which
only the mainland terrane connections are involved (potentially
between V, C, F, A, E), is represented by the dispersal
multiplier matrix below:

Some of our hypotheses involved recent emergence or
assembly of land masses. We used time-stratified models to
represent these hypotheses, with the “areas available” matrix
and their associated time periods to indicate which areas were
available for occupancy during each time stratum. A single
dispersal multiplier matrix was used across all time strata.
We fit models of historical biogeography using Dispersal-
Extinction-Cladeogenesis (DEC; Ree et al., 2005; Ree and
Smith, 2008) models as implemented in the R package
BioGeoBEARS (Matzke, 2014), allowing a maximum of two areas
per taxon. All DEC models have two degrees of freedom for the
dispersal and extinction rate parameters. Model comparison
was used to evaluate alternative hypotheses of historical
biogeography, assessing model fits with the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC; Burnham and Anderson, 2002). We assessed
sensitivity of model selection to phylogenetic uncertainty (both
topology and branch lengths) by fitting all of the range
evolution models to each of the final 100 phylogenies of our
Bayesian (BEAST2) phylogenetic reconstruction (Hill et al.,
2022).
Using our best-fitting range evolution models, we estimated
ancestral ranges and compared our results with the timings
of terrane-accretion and island formation events (Davies
et al., 1996, 1997; Pigram and Symond, 1991). Reconstructed
ancestral ranges were assigned to nodes by majority rule,
and used to tabulate inferred range shifts, assigning the shift
to the ancestral node along which it occurred. Although all
asterophryine species are single-area endemics, we allowed two
areas per taxon, as required by the software to return a
model fit. We wrote a custom script to apportion the two-
area probabilities equally between the original geogregions.
For example, if the ancestral reconstruction assigned a 10%
probability to a dual geogregion range comprised of the EPCT
+ Fold Belt, half of the probability would be assigned to
the EPCT and half to the Fold Belt. We plotted phylogenies
annotated with model results using the R package ggtree (Yu
et al., 2017).
We note that many biogeographic studies also fit DEC+J
models (Matzke, 2014), which allow an additional parameter
for “jump” or long-distance dispersal. We found that DEC+J
model fits on our data were degenerate as they returned models
with zero dispersal and extinction probabilities, apportioning
all range evolution to long-distance dispersal. Other authors
have reported this model behavior, warning about spurious
interpretations especially in situations where all lineages are
restricted to single areas, as in our system (Matzke, 2014; Reeand Sanmart´ ın, 2018). We therefore did not use DEC+J models
in our study, as these results indicate a pathology of the model
fit rather than a reasonable estimate of reality, which would be
nonsensical given the poor dispersal abilities of frogs.
Hypotheses
Island Distance
The islands of the Bismarck, D’Entrecasteaux, and
Louisiade groups lying off the northeast coast of New Guinea
are surrounded by waters over 100 m deep and vary in distance
to the mainland, which in turn should be inversely proportional
to the probability of overwater dispersal. Therefore, absent
any influence of geological history, nearby islands, such as
New Britain and the D’Entrecasteaux Islands ( <100km away
from the mainland), are expected to experience greater rates of
dispersal than distant islands such as the Louisiade Archipelago
(>200km). We tested this idea by weighting the dispersal
multiplier matrix by distance categories. Thus, the nearby
D’entrecasteaux Islands (Normanby and Fergusson) and New
Britain in relation to any mainland region are assigned a
dispersal multiplier of .1, whereas Woodlark Island and the
islands of the Louisiade Archipelago are assigned a dispersal
multiplier of .001. Within-archipelago movement is assumed
to be unconstrained (i.e., within the D’Entrecasteaux Islands,
within the Louisiades + Woodlark), with a dispersal multiplier
of 1.
Plate Tectonics
Over the past 20M years, there have been significant
land movements whose history may leave signatures in the
present-day distribution of frog lineages. While it is well
established that there are five major tectonic units that joined
to form the New Guinea mainland, there are several geological
hypotheses regarding the timing and order of their spatial
connections. We constructed 11 alternative hypotheses (see
Fig. 3 for explanation) to test these ideas. Our null or baseline
hypothesis “Current Connectivity”(a) represents opportunities
for dispersal based on present-day land connectivity, with no
consideration of geological history. Here, mainland frogs can
disperse freely across the main island of New Guinea, but
overwater dispersal is unlikely. The next three alternative
hypotheses represent the major competing ideas for the
formation of the mainland: “Slow and Steady”, “Mobile Belt”,
and “Recent Emergence” (see introduction for background; and
Fig. 3b-d for descriptions of each scenario).
The remaining hypotheses explore scenarios for the history
of the offshore islands and their relationship to the mainland.
The origins of the Louisiade Archipelago have not been
well studied, but based on petrological similarities, they
are relatively old, being composed of forearc metamorphic
rocks of at least Miocene age whose protoliths date back
to the Cretaceous, and may once have been connected to
other land masses, since their metasedimentary rocks are
correlative to those in the current Owen Stanley Range of
the Papuan Peninsula (Fig. 3e, Davies and Smith, 1971;
Pigram and Davies, 1987; Baldwin et al., 2012). Prior to
the opening of the Woodlark Basin, Woodlark Island was
in close proximity to the Louisiade Archipelago (Fig. 3f,
Pigram and Davies, 1987), possibly representing an element
of the volcanic back-arc behind the Louisiade forearc (Webb
et al., 2014). In its present-day position, Woodlark has been
significantly displaced northward from its paleo-position, dueMovement of frogs or movement of land? 7
to the rapid opening of the Woodlark Basin around 5 Ma.
Another correlated hypothesis regarding the mountains of
the Louisiade Archipelago is that they may represent the
southern most extent of the ancestral Owen Stanley Range,
which might once have been contiguous within the EPCT
before its southeastern extension was isolated due to erosion
and subsidence (Fig. 3g,h). This idea is again supported by
petrological similarities (Davies and Smith, 1971; Pigram and
Davies, 1987). We also include the D’Entrecasteaux Islands
because of their very close proximity to the EPCT (although
three islands comprise the D’Entrecasteaux group – Normanby,
Fergusson, and Goodenough, we have frog genetic data from
only the first two, so our subsequent discussions treat this unit
as a two-island complex). The final hypotheses test whether
the offshore islands share a history with either the EPCT or
the Accreted Terranes, or both, as the latter lie on an active
margin in proximity to the offshore islands (Fig. 3i-k).
Unconstrained DEC
As a point of comparison to the hypotheses informed by
biogeographical evolutionary theory above, we also tested an
“Unconstrained DEC” model with no dispersal multiplier nor
time stratification. This model assumes that it is equally likely
to transition between any two ranges.
Results
The best-fitting overall hypothesis was “j: Offshore with
Nearest Mainland”, and was superior to all other models. This
result was robust to phylogenetic uncertainty, selected as the
best model across the top 100 phylogenetic hypotheses (100%
model selection frequency). The best model incorporates the
“Slow and Steady” hypothesis for mainland assembly and a
shared history between the offshore islands and their nearest
mainland units (the Accreted Terranes for New Britain, and all
others connected to the EPCT; Table 2). Below we report the
strength of evidence for the component ideas.
Mainland Assembly
Comparing only the mainland assembly models, the
distribution of Asterophryinae is best explained by the “b:
Slow and Steady” hypothesis which was far superior to the
“c: Mobile Belt” and “a: Current Connectivity” hypotheses
by 20 and 53 AIC units, respectively. “d: Recent Emergence”
provided a substantially worse fit, by 309 AIC units. All of
these mainland assembly models assumed the offshore islands
remained detached.
Island History
Building upon the “Slow and Steady” hypothesis for
mainland assembly, we explored various hypotheses for the
biogeographic history of the offshore islands. The second best
overall model, by 6 AIC units, was hypothesis “i” in which all
of the offshore islands including New Britain are connected to
the EPCT (and not the Accreted Terranes; Table 2). Switching
the shared history of all the offshore islands from with EPCT
to with the Accreted Terranes provided a very poor fit, with a
∆AIC of 188 for hypothesis “k”.
The best model supports a shared history between Woodlark
Island and the Louisiade Archipelago. We also tested several
other models that compared Woodlark separate from theLouisaides versus joined together, and support was always
improved by joining them. Model fit was further improved
by connecting these to the EPCT, with the third best model
(∆AIC 10; Table 2) being “h: Historical Owen Stanleys”
which posits that the Louisiade Archipelago, Woodlark, and
the D‘Entrecasteux Islands all originated as part of the Owen
Stanleys. Therefore, with the exception of New Britain, we see
a strong signal for even distant offshore islands sharing a history
with the EPCT (Fig: 2, Table 1).
Ahistorical and Hybrid Distance Models
We tested three ahistorical models of interest. Hypothesis
“a: Current connectivity”, implying that the current geography
explains the distribution of Asterophryinae, was one of the
worst fits to the data (∆AIC 436; Table 2). In fact, the
unconstrained DEC model (although not a top model with
∆AIC 23) was nevertheless a substantial improvement over
current connectivity. A hybrid model which built on “b:
Slow and Steady” for mainland assembly, but accounted for
overwater distance to the offshore islands provided a poor
explanation of the data with a ∆AIC of 118.
Reconstructing the Spread of Asterophryinae
From the best-fit model we recover the EPCT as the center
of origin of Asterophryinae placed at about 20 Ma (Feng et al.,
2017; Hill et al., 2022), with subsequent spread throughout
mainland New Guinea and across satellite islands, some more
than 200km away (Fig. 4). We count a minimum of 71 georegion
transitions required to explain the current distribution (42
between the mainland and islands, the remainder between
mainland regions; Table 3). We discuss the implications of our
findings below.
Discussion
The EPCT is the center of origin and ongoing
diversification
The EPCT is a known center of endemism and species
richness across many taxa. Although high mountains are
present in both the Fold Belt and the EPCT, based
on cicada relationships, Duffels (1983) concluded that the
Papuan Peninsula (also known as the EPCT) was a separate
biogeographic area, and not merely an eastward extension of
the New Guinea central mountains. Furthermore, Boer and
Duffels (1996) identified it as a discrete area of endemism
within the Melanesian region. Kalkman et al. (2018) showed
that the EPCT harbored a large number of endemic damselflies
and concluded that a range expansion out of the EPCT
gave rise to the rest of a species-rich clade of damselflies
now found in New Guinea. This is plausible if they arrived
from the EPCT to find much ecological opportunity on a
still relatively depauperate and more recently uplifted New
Guinea. Similarly, Polhemus and Polhemus (2004) noted that
the EPCT supports an unusually rich biota of veliid water
bugs representing numerous endemic genera and species not
found in the remainder of New Guinea as a whole, while at
the same time lacking certain endemic genera occurring in the
main body of the island, indicating separate histories of faunal
evolution followed by fusion of the two land masses. Kraus
(2021) proposed that the opening of the Woodlark Rift and
its ongoing extension has created a series of vicariance events
promoting speciation in multiple lineages.8 Ethan C. Hill, et al.

MSRka. Current Connectivity. Frogs are limited by current geography, 
freely dispersing across contiguous landscape but limited in 
dispersing across water. Light purple connections indicate free
multi-way dispersal accross the mainland, with each island separated 
to reflect the difficulty of overwater dispersal. 
b. Slow and Steady. All models include 13 georegions, one for each 
mainald terrane (rectangle) or island (circle). Each yellow region 
corresponds to a present-day terrane or island. Brown bars represent 
land connections between areas that facilitate dispersal, here only 
between adjacent mainland terranes. 
e. The Louisiade Archipelago. Consisting of the islands 
of Rossel, Sudest and Misima, this archipelago may have
once been a single connected landmass based on core samples 
(Pigram and Davies, 1987). All remaining models assume pairwise 
dispersal corridors accross the mainland (brown bars), with light 
purple indicating multi-way dispersal. 
f. Woodlark with Louisiades. Woodlark may have once been 
connected to the Louisiade Archipelago prior to the opening of the 
Woodlark Basin, a rift which is hypothesized to have carried 
Woodlark Island northward to  its current position (dashed arrow; 
Baldwin, et al. 2012). Builds on (c) and groups Woodlark with the 
Louisiades.
g. Owen Stanleys. The Owen Stanley mountain range extends 
southward along the EPCT. The Louisiade Archipelago may have 
originated from erosion of the southernmost extent of the Owen Stanley 
mountain range (Davies, 2012), and carried away by tectonic activity. 
This hypothesis predicts multiway dispersal between the Louisiades, 
the D'entrecasteaux, and the EPCT. 
h. Historical Owen Stanleys. Combining (f and g), we include 
Woodlark Island with the Louisiades, the D`Entrecasteaux, and 
the EPCT.
i. Offshore Islands share history with EPCT. If the offshore 
islands share a history with any mainland terrane, it is likely to be 
the ocean-facing EPCT or Accreted terranes along the West Coast 
of New Guinea.This hypothesis posits that the offshore islands 
have a geological relationship with the EPCT.
k. Offshore Islands share history with Accreted Terranes. This 
hypothesis posits that all of the offshore islands have a geological 
relationship with the Accreted Terranes.j. Offshore with nearest mainland. New Britain may share a history 
with the Accreted Terranes, being geographically close, and the 
remaining offshore islands share a geological history with the EPCT. c. Mobile Belt. The EPCT and Accreted 
Terranes were assembled offshore, 
prior to 12 Ma, when they jointly 
docked onto the rest of the mainland.

The EPCT itself is a composite terrane, which formed
through multiple tectonic accretion events that began prior
to its attachment to the remainder of New Guinea. This
accretional history is significant in regard to its biotic evolution,
as it may have brought communities together via collision,
or at least within proximity so that dispersal to islands
is possible. Although questions remain regarding the exact
sequence of assembly within the EPCT, the concept of a
composite land mass in eastern New Guinea formed by
the collision of an Australian continental fragment and an
island arc was advanced over 40 years ago in the geologic
literature (Pieters, 1978; Hamilton, 1979), and has been
subsequently supported by more recent research (Webb et al.,
2014). Specifically, the basement rocks of southeastern New
Guinea (the nascent EPCT) represent a displaced fragment
of the Australian continental margin rifted away during the
Cretaceous and moved northeastward by subsequent Paleocene-
Eocene seafloor spreading (Zirakparvar et al., 2013). This
fragment subsequently collided with a Late Paleocene-Early
Eocene island arc to form the initial core of what would become
the Papuan Peninsula (Davies and Warren, 1988), leading tothe emplacement of a broad ophiolite belt banked against the
northern margin of this accreted unit. Such a scenario would
imply that emergent land masses linked to island arcs may have
been present in the vicinity of the current EPCT as early as
the Paleocene, and that orogeny in the EPCT preceded that
in central New Guinea by at least 10 My (Quarles van Ufford
and Cloos, 2005), making it one of the earliest high emergent
land masses in the region. Thus the fact that the EPCT is the
center of diversity for many older lineages is understandable in
the context of this early geological history.
Our studies support this geological scenario, indicating that
the EPCT is not only the origin of diversity for Asterophryinae,
but a source for ongoing diversification and outward expansion
(summarized in Fig. 6). Asterophryinae originated on the
EPCT at least 20 Ma, as did 15 of the 18 genera (this study,
Hill et al., 2022; Rivera et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2017), and
entered the Fold Belt or the Accreted Terranes beginning
around 17 Ma (Fig. 4, 5). This strong signal for an origin on the
EPCT before later dispersing to the Accreted Terranes refutes
the “Mobile Belt” hypothesis, which would predict a joint origin
from both terranes. Instead, our results lend strong support toMovement of frogs or movement of land? 11

the “Slow and Steady” geological model of Pigram and Davies
(1987); Davies (2012), a key prediction of which is that the
Papuan mainland, except for the northern coast of the Accreted
Terranes, was subaerial prior to the Early Miocene, with the
EPCT docking onto the growing New Guinea composite land
mass during the Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene (Davieset al., 1997). The dominance of the clade at low-mid elevation
in the Early Miocene, as well as the exceptionally poor fit of the
“Recent Emergence” model rejects the hypothesis of Hall (2002)
that the bulk of the New Guinea mainland was submerged until
5 Ma.12 Ethan C. Hill, et al.
What is more remarkable, however, is the coincidence of
the timings of geological events and range transitions, and
furthermore, the sheer volume of phylogenetically independent
dispersals (71) across 18 genera. First, the docking of the EPCT
to the Papuan mainland would have created new overland
dispersal routes between major landmasses from the EPCT to
the Accreted Terranes and the Fold Belt, bringing the first
frogs to the growing New Guinea Island. We see that the vast
majority of dispersals come out of the EPCT. Of the mainland
to mainland dispersals, 48% originate from the EPCT, and
dispersals to islands are nearly exclusively from the EPCT
at 98%. Indeed in our biogeographic results, we see a wave
of dispersal across the older genera of Asterophryinae in an
“out of the EPCT to the north” pattern in: Oreophryne A ,
Cophixalus ,Choerophryne , and Austrochaperina B in relation
toBaryengys (Fig. 5), with each genus independently splitting
into EPCT vs. Accreted Terrane/Fold Belt divisions at the
same point in asterophryine history (Fig. 4), leading to major
subclades with ongoing diversification. In the discussion that
follows, we acknowledge that both the phylogenetic dating and
geological dating is approximate. Nevertheless, that we recover
very similar date ranges along independent branches of the
phylogenetic tree, and that these range shifts coincide with the
approximate dating of geological events is remarkable.
The coincidence of geology with dispersal
About 12 Ma, there are multiple major geological events:
orogeny of the central cordillera, docking of the Vogelkop
Peninsula, and the opening of the Woodlark Basin. The orogeny
of the central mountains of the Fold Belt began about 12 Ma
(Pigram and Davies, 1987; Pigram and Symond, 1991; Davies
et al., 1996; Quarles van Ufford and Cloos, 2005; Davies, 2012;
Baldwin et al., 2012). Transitions from the EPCT into the
Accreted Terranes and/or the Fold Belt tapered off ∼12 Ma
(Fig. 5), when the central mountains may have risen high
enough to become a geographic barrier for some lineages.
Members of the genera Choerophryne ,Oreophryne A , and
Hylophorbus moved from the Accreted Terranes to the Fold
Belt∼12-8 Ma, as the mountains were rising. A final burst
of transitions of three genera from the EPCT to the Accreted
Terranes occurred ∼4 Ma, with the docking of the Huon-
Finisterre-Adelbert blocks of the Bismarck Plate, which must
have arrived without any preexisting Asterophryinae species.
Contemporaneously in time, ∼14 Ma, the genus Asterophrys
expanded from the Fold Belt to the Vogelkop Peninsula,
coincident with the docking of the Vogelkop Peninsula (Pigram
and Davies, 1987; Polhemus and Polhemus, 1998; Quarles van
Ufford and Cloos, 2005; Davies, 2012), rather than the more
recent date of 7-3 Ma proposed by Holm et al. (2019). The
timing of these transitions closer to the mid-Miocene further
supports the “Slow and Steady” model rather than the “Recent
Emergence” model (Hall, 1998, 2002).
Along the southern tip of New Guinea, also beginning about
∼12 Ma, was the rifting off of the southern end of the Owen
Stanley Range in the EPCT into the Louisiade Archipelago and
Woodlark Island. We see a very strong signature of this event in
our model fits, as any model linking the Louisiade Archipelago
and Woodlark to the EPCT provides a far superior fit to similar
models without this motif. At this time, the EPCT would
have presumably been fully populated with potential source
populations for dispersal across small water gaps or may have
already populated the area that became newly isolated islands.
This scenario would readily explain the skewed distribution oftwelve range transitions involving seven genera coincident in
time to these islands, concentrated around the 12 Ma mark,
followed by continuing range transitions that taper off as the
islands would be rifting farther away. It would also explain why
the species on these islands were independently seeded from
the EPCT, and not arising by rare dispersal followed by in-situ
diversification, and also explain why species do not disperse in
a stepping stone manner to the islands. Indeed it is remarkable
that all species have closest sisters on the EPCT, and in-situ
radiation on the islands is rare (plates of some of pairs of
relatives across the EPCT and offshore islands are shown in
Fig. 7a,b).
Finally, the recent rise of the D’Entrecasteaux Islands and
the close approach of New Britain Island demonstrate that
at very close distances, oceanic dispersal is possible even for
terrestrial frogs, as lineages on these nearby islands which were
never connected are related to sisters on the EPCT.
The best-fitting overall hypothesis was “j:Offshore Islands
with Nearest Mainland”, which is a refinement of “Slow and
Steady” and supports these geological scenarios regarding the
origins of the offshore islands discussed below. Thus, the
hypderdiversity of this low-dispersal clade can be explained
by major land movements that provide multiple vicariance
events through time, which allowed numerous genera to
simultaneously speciate (Fig. 5), and lend strong support for
the role of geology in driving ongoing diversification.
Long-distance dispersal vs. carriage by plate tectonics
With the large number of inferred range transition
events (71 transitions), a naive interpretation would be that
dispersal is frequent. However, phylogenetic evidence confirms
that these species are poor dispersers. In addition to the
numerous instances of cryptic species within Asterophryinae
(i.e., phylogenetically distinct sister lineages in close spatial
proximity (Hill et al., 2022)), from our DEC modeling, we
recover an overall rate of extinction that is higher than the rate
of dispersal, consistent with a clade of low-dispersing organisms
that tend to readily fragment by isolation. Furthermore, with
regard to the mainland tectonic units, if long-distance dispersal
were common, an unrestricted model allowing free dispersal
between any two mainland units should be favored. Instead,
our results show that a model limiting dispersal to adjacent
tectonic units was far superior (“Slow and Steady” fit better
than “Current Connectivity” by 53 AIC units). Nearly all range
shifts occur in a single step (Fig. 5). Where a lineage passes
through multiple terranes, they do so in a stepwise manner:
the ancestor of Asterophrys andXenorhina originated on the
EPCT, then dispersed to the Fold Belt, then to the Vogelkop
peninsula. All of these findings point to the difficulty of long-
distance dispersal. However, the frequency of range transitions
can be understood in the context of plate tectonics.
Especially with regard to the offshore islands, we originally
thought that our phylogeny (presented in: Hill et al., 2022)
must be wrong. How could small terrestrial frogs disperse
over hundreds of kilometers of open ocean, separated by 10
MY from their nearest sister lineage on the EPCT? Frogs
are notoriously poor oceanic dispersers (Duellman and Trueb,
1994), which is supported by experimental evidence with adult
anurans suffering toxicity at 80% of ocean salinity, and embryos
developmentally impaired if exposed to only 25% of ocean
salinity (Gordon et al., 1961; Hopkins et al., 2012; Seymour,
1994). Yet situations are known where rare oceanic dispersal
must have occurred, such as on the Comoro ArchipelagoMovement of frogs or movement of land? 13

situated between Madagascar and Africa, which is home to two
endemic anuran species but with its volcanic origin has never
been connected to Madagascar nor Africa (Vences et al., 2003),
and in this study, with regard to the D‘Entrecasteaux Islands
and New Britain.
In the present study, we did not find that frogs dispersed
in a stepping-stone fashion from nearer to more distant
islands (the Island Distance model was a very poor fit
with ∆AIC 118, Table 2), as would be predicted by Island
Biogeography Theory (MacArthur and Wilson, 1967; Losos and
Ricklefs, 2009). All source populations are directly from the
mainland. Furthermore, we see no evidence for community-wide
vicariance. Communities on islands are generally composed
of individual representatives of multiple genera and therefore
species within a community are connected by deep histories
(Hill et al., 2022), and furthermore, each species is sister to
taxa from different source populations on the mainland. If there
were evidence of community-wide vicariance, we would expect
that models that group archipelagos together such as “e: The
Louisiade Archipelago” would provide a much better fit.
On the other hand, if islands were always separated
requiring rare over-water dispersal, we would expect the “a:
Current Connectivity” hypothesis to provide a better fit.
Instead, it provides amongst the worst fit. Intriguingly, it is
a substantially worse fit than the unconstrained DEC model,
which makes no assumptions about connectivity and therefore
implies that all regions are equally connected. The answer that
emerges from the amalgamation of evidence is that the frogs
in most cases dispersed over land connections or very narrow
water gaps, which themselves evolved over time. One possibility
is that in rare events, frogs may have rafted across on fallen
trees, which can happen during monsoons or tropical storms.
Nevertheless, dispersal over narrow water gaps would allow
arrivals from independent source populations for as long as the
island was within close proximity, which may change with plate
tectonic movements.
The Louisade Archipelago
These islands are an excellent case in point for diversification
driven by vicariance via plate tectonic movements, being
distant offshore islands that are home to over 18 candidate
species of Asterophryinae (Boulenger, 1890; M´ ehel¨ y, 1901;
Zweifel, 1963, 1972; Zweifel and Tyler, 1982; Burton, 1986;
Zweifel, 2000; Richards and Oliver, 2007; Kraus and Allison,
2009; Kraus, 2016), yet separated by over 200km of saltwater
barrier from any potential source population. Rather than
inferring 18 independent dispersals within the last 12 million
years, an alternative hypothesis is that they may have
fragmented from the Papuan mainland. If dispersal was to
a remote oceanic island at fixed distance from the source
population, we would expect to see a random pattern in
the timing of dispersal events. Instead, the data show that
the dispersals, all originating from the EPCT, are highly
concentrated at ∼12 Ma, followed by a tapering off until ∼4
Ma, consistent with islands fragmenting off of a mainland
source (Fig. 5). Geological evidence supports this scenario.
Petrological samples taken from the Louisiade Archipelago are
similar in composition to those of the Owen Stanley Range on
the EPCT indicating a shared geological history between these
two seemingly distinct landmasses (Pigram and Davies, 1987;
Davies, 2012; Baldwin et al., 2012).
In the work of Pigram and Davies (1987) the Louisiade
Islands are shown as a disjunct sector of the Owen StanleyTerrane, most of which lies in the interior of the Papuan
Peninsula. In their current form, they represent the partially
drowned remnants of an old mountain range that ran down the
middle of what is now the EPCT, and the metasedimentary
rocks of the Louisiade Archipelago have been correlated
with those of the Owen Stanley Range (Davies and Smith,
1971). The protoliths of these metasedimentary rocks are
Cretaceous volcaniclastic sediments derived from the eastern
Australian continental margin (Zirakparvar et al., 2013),
and the metamorphic rocks of the Lousiades have been
interpreted to represent mid-Cretaceous sediments scraped off
of a subducting plate and incorporated into an accretionary
wedge in the fore arc of a southward-migrating Miocene volcanic
arc over northward dipping subduction. Woodlark Island may
represent a remnant of the volcanic back-arc associated with
this system (Webb et al., 2014). These scenarios would imply
that emergent land masses may have been present in the
Louisiades sector since at least the Early Miocene.
Woodlark Island
This island is currently >200km from the Papuan mainland,
lying in an isolated position to the northeast, and also
contains a surprising number of Asterophryinae species, all
with sister taxa on the EPCT (Fig. 4). Pigram and Davies
(1987) treated Woodlark as lying on a separate terrane from
the Louisiades, but noted that it had a basement of Eocene
age, overlain by Oligocene limestones. Webb et al. (2014)
suggested that Woodlark Island might represent a remnant of
the volcanic back-arc associated with the Miocene arc that
formed the Louisiades, which is consistent with its basement
of pre-Miocene basalts reported by Ashley and Flood (1981),
indicating that Woodlark and the Louisiades may have had a
linked tectonic history. One hypothesis is that Woodlark was
adjacent to the Louisiade Archipelago (Pigram and Davies,
1987; Baldwin et al., 2012), prior to the opening up of the
Woodlark Basin which formed by rifting that initiated in
the Late Miocene and continues to the present time (Webb
et al., 2014). This rifting displaced the submarine ridge that
Woodlark sits on to the northeast, pushing it away from its
previous proximity to the Louisiades. This geological model is
consistent with the large number of independent frog dispersals
to Rossel (currently the most easterly of the Louisiades),
Sudest and Woodlark Islands, between ∼12–8 Ma, consistent
with the hypothesized timing of fragmentation among these
three islands. Thus the initial proximity of Woodlark Island
to the Louisiades provided opportunities for dispersal and
differentiation, which tapered off as the oceanic gap widened.
Misima Island, which is the most westerly of the Louisiades and
nearest to New Guinea, has a later history of dispersal from the
EPCT, starting around ∼6 Ma, consistent with a more recent
separation.
Southeast Asia
The historical genus Oreophryne was recently identified as
two distinct and unrelated genera Oreophryne A which is the
oldest genus of Asterophryinae, and a younger, unrelated clade
Oreophryne B (Hill et al., 2022). We have four Oreophryne
samples from this region, two species in Oreophryne A from
the Philippines which are sister to species on the Accreted
Terranes, and two species in Oreophryne B from Sulawesi
which are sister to species on the EPCT. McGuire et al.
(2023) has proposed overwater dispersal to Sulawesi in flying
lizards. While we cannot rule out overwater dispersal for frogs,Movement of frogs or movement of land? 15
dispersal to Sulawesi could be facilitated by westward-motion
along the Pacific plate boundary, where accommodation of
convergence has sheared fragments from northern New Guinea
and sent them westward towards the Sulawesi region (Hamilton,
1979; Polhemus, 2007) along a series of left-lateral fault
zones. These cases suggest an out-of-PNG to the Sunda Arc
dispersal route hypothesis. Recently, several additional genera
of Asterophryinae from Southeast Asia have been described:
Siamophryne, Gastrophrynoides , and Vietnamophryne and
were found to be basal sisters of the Papuan Asterophryinae
(Poyarkov et al., 2018; Suwannapoom et al., 2018). This
was interpreted as evidence for a “down-from-Southeast-Asia”
pattern of dispersal (Tyler, 1979). More sampling of species as
well as inclusion of nuclear genes in phylogenetic analyses is
required to resolve the structure of the Southeast Asian clades
in relation to the Papuan clades and to determine whether
such faunal disjunction might be linked to much earlier tectonic
events.
Limited over water dispersal
Several islands contain Asterophryinae species but have
never been connected to the New Guinea mainland, and as
such must have been colonized by over-water dispersal. These
include the D’Entrecasteaux Islands and New Britain in the
Bismarck Archipelago. Asterophryines are absent from the
other islands in the Bismarck Archipelago, viz. New Ireland,
New Hanover and Manus islands.
The D’Entrecasteaux Islands
The D’Entrecasteaux group of islands lies close to the
Papuan Peninsula of New Guinea (40km from the EPCT,
Table 1), and contains an exceptional diversity of 18 candidate
species on Normanby Island, with more modest assemblages
on Fergusson and fewer yet on Goodenough. We note that
we lack genetic samples from Goodenough, but we know
the environment is a bit more xeric and less suitable for
frogs. Asterophryinae dispersal to the D’Entrecasteaux Islands
began ∼8–5 Ma and continues to the present (Figure 5).
These islands are an emergent metamorphic core complex,
consisting of gneiss and amphibolite domes with granodiorite
cores (Pigram and Davies, 1987), and with the potential
exception of part of Normanby, were never connected to the
mainland. They are not volcanic features, but instead seem
to represent incipiently subducted continental crust that has
rebounded back up through the zone of weakness at the west
end of the Woodlark Rift (Baldwin et al., 2008; Wallace et al.,
2014). They are also relatively new islands, of Pliocene age or
later (Abers et al., 2002), and are still rising and enlarging. So
unlike the Louisiades, which are old islands that are becoming
progressively smaller, the D’Entrecasteaux group consists of
young islands that are becoming progressively larger. As such,
they are a very recent colonization target that has required
overwater dispersal to reach.
Goodenough and Fergusson Islands are internally cohesive
emergent metamorphic units, while Normanby Island has a
more complicated and potentially composite history. The island
is divided by a right-lateral strike-slip fault (Wallace et al.,
2014). The narrower western section of Normanby, to the north
of this fault, is of similar composition and origin to Goodenough
and Fergusson Islands, while the larger, furrowed eastern
section is a separate lithological unit that is more allied to parts
of the Owen Stanley uplift in the central Papuan Peninsula
(Baldwin et al., 2012). Thus, the section of Normanby whereour samples were collected, with a surprising species richness
(18 candidate species), may be of separate origin more closely
linked to the EPCT, possibly representing a younger version of
the situation in the Louisiades. The different tectonic histories
of Normanby versus Fergusson and Goodenough help to explain
the species diversity disparities, while providing evidence that
overwater dispersal can occur when sufficiently short distances
are involved.
New Britain Island
Currently there are only two species of Asterophryinae
known to be present on New Britain, Austrochaperina A
novaebritanniae whose sister taxon is from the Accreted
Terranes, and Oreophryne A brachypus with a sister taxon
on the EPCT. These are clearly two independent dispersal
events within the past 3 Ma. Given that New Britain
is the largest offshore island and also among the closest
(Table 1), the question should be why isn‘t it home to
more species? One hypothesis is that the genus Cornufer
of the family Certatobatrachidae likely arrived first to New
Britain and has radiated extensively (Brown et al., 2015),
possibly excluding microhylids. Another possibility is dispersal
limitation. Considering that New Britain is on a collision
course with the Papuan mainland, and currently lies as close
as it ever has to New Guinea (Kroenke et al., 1984; Pigram
and Davies, 1987; Polhemus and Polhemus, 1998; Quarles van
Ufford and Cloos, 2005; Baldwin et al., 2012; Davies, 2012). In
this case, overwater dispersal is the only mechanism available
to frogs, and the distance of ∼80km may represent an overwater
dispersal limit. The low number of asterophryne species despite
its large land area makes sense in this context, but this situation
certainly merits further study.
A Comment About Model Based Approaches to
Biogeography
We employed a phylogenetic model-based approach to
explore hypotheses about historical biogeography. That is,
we constructed a series of models that approximate our
hypothetical phenomena (i.e., distance, various geological
scenarios), and allowed them to compete for the best
explanation of the data. Luckily, despite the complexity of
hypotheses involving partial areas, it appears that our model
fits are additive such that for example – the addition of
Woodlark Island to the Louisiade Archipelago produces the
same improvement of fit regardless of the assumptions of other
parts of the model. We caution that this need not be the
case, and care must be taken in making such assessments.
Nevertheless, the gains for biology in rigorous interrogation of
models are tremendous. By comparing models head to head, we
could clearly identify which ideas were supported by data, and
which were not.
It has been noted by Ree and Sanmart´ ın (2018) that
many studies do not exploit the power of model specification
flexibility afforded by the DEC class models. Rather,
most studies limit the comparison to major classes of
models (i.e., DEC, DEC+J, DIVA), but do not vary the
model to approximate the actual phenomena of interest,
leaving conclusions to interpretation of the ancestral range
reconstructions. Interpretation of model results is, of course,
very important, but we agree that the most commonly used
strategy represents a missed opportunity to use the power
of statistical model-comparison approaches to drill down into
the exploration of the data. We can use a hypothesis-driven16 Ethan C. Hill, et al.
phylogenetic approach to differentiate between customized
hypotheses to test specific biological or geological phenomena.
Conclusions
We find using an explicit model-based approach reveals
clear signals in the data with very strong support for each
of these model additions: the pairwise connections of the
mainland, and the affiliation of the Louisiades+Woodlark with
the EPCT, as well as the D’Entrecasteux Islands. Together with
the interpretation of the ancestral range reconstructions and
their coincidence in timing with geological events, they support
the “Slow and Steady” geological hypothesis for the formation
of the region (Pigram and Davies, 1987; Davies et al., 1996;
Polhemus and Polhemus, 1998; Quarles van Ufford and Cloos,
2005; Davies, 2012), with the EPCT as the center of origin and
source for ongoing diversification. In a group with impossibly
complex distribution yet with poor dispersal ability to islands
with no current connection to mainland, we need not accept
wild dispersal scenarios. We can rigorously test geological ideas
to find a strongly supported biogeographical model involving
dispersal over land connections (in multiple varieties of joining
and fragmenting) or over narrow water gaps to explain the
convoluted dispersal pathways and exuberant diversity of the
Asterophryinae.
Importantly, we find important consequences for biodiversity
in the fact that the earth’s surface is not fixed but itself evolves.
Not only can land area change over time, sometimes increasing
by volcanism or shrinking through erosion, but the distances
between land masses can evolve as well, changing the degree of
isolation through time and providing another axis upon which
geological evolution can alter the dynamics of biotic evolution.
