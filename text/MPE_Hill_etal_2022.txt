Cryptic species ABSTRACT  
The microhylid frogs of the New Guinea region are the largest and most ecologically diverse subfamily (Aster -
ophryinae) of one of the largest anuran families in the world and can live in communities of up to 20 species. 
While there has been recent progress in resolving the phylogenetic relationships of Asterophryinae, significant 
uncertainties remain, impeding further progress in understanding the evolution of microhabitat use, parental 
care, and life history variation in this group. In particular, the early divergences at the base of the tree remain 
unclear; as does the monophyly of some genera; and recent studies have discovered that species with wide 
geographic distribution are instead cryptic species complexes. In this study, we fortified geographic sampling of 
the largest previous phylogenetic effort by sequencing an additional 62 taxa and increased data quality and 
quantity by adding new layers of data vetting and by filling in previously incomplete loci to the five gene dataset 
(2 mitochondrial, 3 nuclear protein-coding genes) to obtain a dataset that is now 99% complete in over 2400 
characters for 233 samples (205 taxa) of Asterophryinae and 3 outgroup taxa, and analyzed microhabitat use 
data for these taxa from field data and data collected from the literature. Importantly, our sampling includes 
complete community complements at 19 sites as well as representatives at over 80 sites across New Guinea and 
its offshore islands. We present a highly resolved molecular phylogeny which, for the first time, has over 95% of 
nodes supported (84% highly supported) whether using Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian Inference, allowing 
clarification of all genera (whether monophyletic or clearly not), their sister genera relationships, as well as an 
age estimate for the Asterophryinae at approximately 20MYA. Early generic diversification occurring between 17 
and 12 MYA gave rise to a surprising diversity of about 18 genera as well as the 5 putative microhabitat types. 
Our tree reveals extensive cryptic diversity calling any widespread taxa into doubt, and clearly demonstrates that 
complex multispecies communities of Asterophryinae are ecologically diverse, are numerous, and of ancient 
origin across New Guinea. We discuss the implications of our phylogeny for explaining the explosive diversifi -
cation of Asterophryinae as the result of adaptive radiation, niche conservatism, and non-adaptive radiation.   
1.Introduction 
A robust phylogenetic hypothesis is central to the study of biodi -
versity (Hunt et al., 2007; Vieites et al., 2009; Jetz et al., 2012; Feng 
et al., 2017 ). Simpson (1953) viewed adaptive radiation as special pe-
riods in evolutionary history when lineages shift into new adaptive 
zones that promotes phenotypic change and lineage diversification, an idea that we can now address with modern phylogenetic approaches 
(eg., Schluter, 2000; Grant and Grant, 2008; Gillespie et al., 2020 ). 
Nearly all modern investigations of evolutionary processes rely on 
phylogenies with clear timings and orders of branching events to inform 
evolutionary models, such as when exploring the geospatial history of 
clades (Ree et al., 2005; Van Dam and Matzke, 2016 ), community as-
sembly (Webb et al., 2002; Emerson and Gillespie, 2008 ), or rates of

2diversification (Ricklefs, 2007; Alfaro et al., 2009 ), among other pro-
cesses. At the same time, clades with the greatest diversity provide the 
greatest phylogenetic challenges, with their large numbers of taxa and 
short branch lengths during periods of rapid diversification, often pre-
cisely where the evolutionary process is most interesting. One such 
example is the hyperdiverse Asterophryinae frogs, which has been the 
subject of phylogenetic revision and re-revision for decades (Savage, 
1973; van Bocxlaer et al., 2006; Frost et al., 2006; Kohler and Günther, 
2008; van der Meijden et al., 2007; Rivera et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2018; 
Dubois et al., 2021 ). 
The Asterophryinae subfamily of microhylid frogs is exceptionally 
diverse, with over 340 species and counting (AmphibiaWeb, 2020 ), 
representing over half of the world ’s diversity of the family Micro -
hyildae on a comparatively tiny fraction of the earth ’s surface. Centered 
in the Papuan region, they are the dominant anuran fauna of New 
Guinea and its surrounding islands (including the D’Entrecasteaux 
islands, other small satellite islands, and the Bismarck and Louisiade 
Archipelagos) and also extending into Malaysia, the Philippines, along 
the northeastern coast of Australia, and recently described from 
Thailand and Vietnam. Asterophryinae are exceptionally diverse in 
ecology with arboreal, scansorial, terrestrial, fossorial, and semi-aquatic 
lifestyles evolving multiple times within the clade (Zweifel and Tyler, 
1983; Kohler and Günther, 2008; Rivera et al., 2017 ) and can exist in 
complex communities of up to 20 species per site (Bickford, 2002 ), 
features that are common to adaptive radiations. However, given the 
turbulent geological history of the Papuan region, with landmasses 
variously colliding and creating mountain ranges, being pulled apart 
into islands, or eroded, there exist ample opportunities for allopatric 
speciation for the astounding accumulation of biodiversity. Further 
progress on the explanation of biodiversity, however, has been 
hampered by the lack of a robust phylogeny. 
While the subfamily Asterophryinae is clearly monophyletic, it has 
long been recognized that the systematic treatment of its genera is 
challenging (Savage, 1973; van Bocxlaer et al., 2006; Frost et al., 2006; 
Kohler and Günther, 2008; van der Meijden et al., 2007; Rivera et al., 
2017; Tu et al., 2018; Dubois et al., 2021 ). Part of the reason is the lack 
of phylogenetically informative morphological characters. Some of the 
features used in the original phylogenetic treatments were later 
discovered to be homoplastic, such as digital disk development (i.e., toe 
pad size) and toe and tibiofibula length (Boulenger, 1890; Zweifel, 
1972 ), all characters associated with lifestyle; or have involved multiple 
independent loss or reduction as in the clavicles, procoracoids, and the 
pectoral girdle (Duellman and Trueb, 1985; Burton, 1986; Burton, 
1990 ). In addition, traits associated with the skull are highly variable, 
such as the maxillary bones, dentaries, nasal development, vomer 
expansion, and vomer spikes (Parker, 1934; Zweifel, 1972 ), rendering 
their inclusion of limited phylogenetic value. 
Recent molecular phylogenies for Asterophryinae have begun to 
clarify generic relationships with inclusion of additional taxa and mo-
lecular markers (Kohler and Günther, 2008; van der Meijden et al., 
2007; de Sa et al., 2012; Peloso et al., 2016; Rivera et al., 2017; Tu et al., 
2018 ). There is now strong evidence for the sister clade relationship of 
Mantophryne and Hylophorbus , with Callulops sister to both genera 
(Rittmeyer et al., 2012; Oliver et al., 2013; Peloso et al., 2016; Rivera 
et al., 2017 ). Xenorhina has strong support as the sister clade to Callulops 
Mantophryne Hylophorbus (Rivera et al., 2017 ). There is strong ev-
idence for the synonymization of Albericus and Choerophryne (Peloso 
et al., 2016; Rivera et al., 2017 ). While earlier studies suggested that 
Cophixalus was not monophyletic (Kohler and Günther, 2008; Pyron and 
Wiens, 2011; Rittmeyer et al., 2012 ), the monophyly of Cophixalus was 
later confirmed with the genus arising early in the history of the sub-
family (Peloso et al., 2016; Rivera et al., 2017 ). 
Despite tremendous progress, intergeneric relationships along the 
backbone of the Asterophryinae phylogeny remains largely unresolved. 
Importantly, this means that the placement of most genera within the 
larger phylogeny is uncertain, and their order of diversification is not known. Furthermore, the monophyly of several genera remains unre-
solved. The most enigmatic clade is the geographically widespread 
genus Oreophryne , ranging across New Guinea and its satellite islands 
and portions of Southeast Asia. While Kohler and Günther (2008) found 
Oreophryne to be monophyletic, the addition of species has since 
complicated the taxonomy, with various workers suggesting the exis-
tence of two or three clades (with the inclusion of Aphantophryne and 
possibly Paedophryne ; Rivera et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2018 ), and 
disagreement on whether one of the Oreophryne clades is the most basal 
clade of Asterophryinae. Additional questions remain for Austro -
chaperina, Copiula, Liophryne and Genyophryne . 
Another issue potentially contributing to systematic challenges is 
cryptic diversity – defined as two or more morphologically similar 
species that are mistakenly classified under a single species (Bickford 
et al., 2007; Funk et al., 2012 ). At the most basic level, without the 
proper recognition of cryptic species, biodiversity is substantially 
underestimated (e.g., Hebert et al., 2004; Bickford et al., 2007; Lahaye 
et al., 2008; Vieites et al., 2009 ), leading to an incomplete understanding 
of diversity in all aspects of the group – including life history, evolu -
tionary history, biogeography, and genetic diversity. While many 
studies focus on coalescent-based approaches at the interface of popu -
lation genetics and phylogenetics to delineate relatively recent cases of 
cryptic speciation (Heled and Drummond, 2010; Liu et al., 2010; Chif-
man and Kubatko, 2014 ), even for studies involving deep evolutionary 
divergences, the existence of unrecognized candidate species is 
increasingly recognized as a common occurrence that cannot be ignored 
(Fouquet et al., 2007; Rovito et al., 2013a ). In systematic studies, un-
recognized cryptic diversity can lead to undersampling of lineages, 
potentially missing taxa that could break up long branches if they were 
recognized as distinct species (Felsenstein, 2004 ). Frogs have long been 
recognized as a key target for cryptic species investigations (Bickford 
et al., 2007; Funk et al., 2012 ), and cryptic diversity is increasingly 
recognized in Asterophryinae (Oliver et al., 2013; Oliver et al., 2017 ). In 
addition, many New Guinean microhylid species remain unnamed, 
further complicating the assessment of the biodiversity within commu -
nities and the subfamily at large as well as difficulty in elucidating its 
organization. 
To facilitate meaningful evolutionary studies of Asterophryinae, we 
revisit the phylogeny, importantly expanding geographic and species 
sampling to 233 samples comprising 205 taxa, including several from 
the Philippines and Western Indonesia. We evaluate the monophyly of 
all currently recognized genera, as well as resolving their timing and 
order of branching. We begin with the assumption that cryptic diversity 
is present and include multiple sites for nominal species, and evaluate 
the spatial scale over which candidate species in our phylogeny vary. 
Using our phylogeny, we analyze the evolution of microhabitat use as 
well as characterize complex microhylid communities. We discuss 
whether ecological variation evolves early in the history of Astero -
phryinae with subsequent community assembly, or whether it arises by 
the colonization of a new area with subsequent diversification. And 
finally, we consider whether our notions of lineage diversification have 
influenced our taxonomy. 
2.Materials and methods 
2.1. Taxon sampling and data collection 
This study includes 233 samples of Asterophryinae containing 205 
taxa (including 122 named and an additional 83 putative taxa) repre -
senting all known genera. The phylogeny was rooted using three out-
group taxa include the hypothesized sister taxon and more distantly 
related lineages – Dyscophus antongilii , Scaphiophryne marmorata , and 
Platypelis grandis (van der Meijden et al., 2007; Tu et al., 2018 ). The 
Asterophryinae samples span over 80 sites across New Guinea (Fig. 1; 
see Table 1 in Hill et al., submitted for publication ), the Philippines, and 
Indonesia. A previous study included 157 Asterophryinae samples E.C. Hill et al.

3Rivera et al. (2017) , the current study expands this dataset by 74 sam-
ples. Forty-seven taxa were obtained from new field collections which 
targeted multi-species communities at six sites across Papua New 
Guinea: five mainland multi-species community sites (Kamiali [site 30], 
Morobe Province; Gerebu [site 39], Central Province; and Rondon Ridge 
[site 20], Western Highlands Province), one mainland site with a single 
species (Baiyer River [site 19], Western Highlands Province), and two 
satellite island multi-species community sites (Mwatebu [site 66] and 
Buyetai [site 64], on Normanby Island, Milne Bay Province). 
Field workers collected frogs after sunset, slowly walking through 
the habitat listening for frog calls, and capturing frogs by hand. Animals 
were euthanized using MS-222 following UH IACUC protocol 12–1458 
to M. Butler with liver samples stored in 70% EtOH and specimens 
preserved for morphological study and deposited at the Bishop Museum 
or University or Michigan Museum of Zoology. Previously reported 
samples Rivera et al. (2017) were obtained via tissue loan from the 
Bishop Museum, Honolulu, Hawaii (BPBM), Museum of Vertebrate 
Zoology at Berkeley (UMZ), University of Michigan Museum of Zoology 
(UMMZ), Zoologisches Museum Berlin (ZMB), and University of Kansas 
Biodiversity Institute and Natural History Museum (KU). Specimen 
accession numbers and metadata are reported in Table 1 of Hill et al. 
(submitted for publication) . Total DNA was extracted from liver samples stored in 70% ethanol 
using the Qiagen DNeasy extraction kit following manufacturer ’s pro-
tocols. Five rare samples were repaired using the NEB “preCR Repair 
Mix” following manufacturer ’s protocols prior to PCR amplification. 
These included samples which may have been formalin fixed (Aphan -
tophryne pansa.1 BPBM5299 and Aphantophryne pansa.2 BPBM8312) or 
slightly degraded during shipment from the field (Rondon Ridge: 
Asterophrys sp. AA24862 & Callulops wilhelmanus.sp.1 AA24828; Baiyer 
River: Hylophorbus rufescens.sp.2 AA24930). 
The five locus dataset (⊃2500 bp) contains three nuclear (Seventh in 
Absentia (SIA), Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Sodium 
Calcium Exchange subunit-1 (NXC-1)), and two mitochondrial loci 
(Cytochrome oxidase b (CYTB), and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 
(ND4)), selected in a previous study (Rivera et al., 2017 ) to span a range 
of evolutionary rates sufficient to infer a phylogeny with time depth of 
approximately 25MY. We redesigned all primers for improved perfor -
mance (see Table 2 in Hill et al., submitted for publication ) based on 
Asterophryinae sequences downloaded from GenBank (Sayers et al., 
2022 ) including whole mitochondrial genomes Tu et al. (2018) as well 
as our previous sequencing efforts. Primers for the nuclear loci were 
designed using NCBI Primer-BLAST software (Ye et al., 2012 ), and for 
the mitochondrial loci degenerate primers were designed against the

terranes. The major geologic terranes of New Guinea are labeled following Davies (2012) : the Eastern Papuan Composite Terrane, the Accreted Terrane, the Fold Belt, 
the Australian Craton, and the Vogelkop Peninsula. Insets magnify areas with tight clusters of sites to show more detail. Site numbers with the names of their 
respective localities are as follows: sites 8–10 Torricelli Mountains, 11–13 Mt. Itukua, 28–32 Bowutu Mountains, 36–39 Mt. Vorivori and Mt. Gerebu, 40–43 Mt. 
Obree, 45–47 Mt. Victory and Mt. Trafalgar, 48–52 Mt. Dayman and Mt. Suckling, 55–59 Owen Stanley Mountains, 62–66 Normanby Island, 70–73 Sudest Island. Site 
names, GPS coordinates, and metadata are provided in Table 1 in Hill et al. (submitted for publication) . E.C.

4multispecies alignment using HYDEN (Linhart and Shamir, 2002 ) using 
default settings. Standard PCR protocols (initial denaturation 1.5 m at 
94•followed by 30 cycles of 94•for 30s, annealing temperatures for 30s 
and extension at 72•for 60s) were used with GoTaq Green Master Mix 
(Promega) protocols (0.4uM-0.8uM of each primer with ⊃5 ng of 
genomic DNA per 25uL reaction). Touchdown PCR and/or nested PCR 
was used to improve amplification for difficult targets. For touchdown 
PCR, annealing temperature generally started at at 5•above Tm (see 
Table 2 in Hill et al., submitted for publication ) and decreased by 1•per 
cycle for the first 10 cycles, followed by 25 cycles at the lowest annealing 
temperature. Some combinations of NXC-1 and ND4 primers required 
the touchdown window of 55–45•. A 15 degree touchdown window was 
used for CytB, as necessary, to improve yield likely due to the de-
generacy or the greater Tm disparity between forward and reverse 
primers. The PCR product was cleaned using NEB Monarch spin columns 
(PCR DNA cleanup kit protocol). Sanger sequencing followed standard 
protocols using Applied Biosystems BigDye terminator chemistry on an 
ABI 3730XL sequencer at the University of Hawaii at Manoa ’s Advanced 
Studies of Genomics, Proteomics and Bioinformatics facility (https:// 
www.hawaii.edu/microbiology/asgpb/). 
High-quality sequence data were filtered using multiple quality 
checks: quality scores (F40%), BLAST confirmation of loci, curation by 
pairwise alignment between taxa for each locus, and scrutinizing any 
distances that did not align with initial assignments to genera. 
Furthermore, we examined the placement of taxa in phylogenetic trees, 
by locus and other subsets of the data with the aim of identifying for 
further scrutiny any samples that were far from their putative relatives. 
Any suspect data were confirmed by resequencing with new PCR 
primers and increased PCR stringency as appropriate. In all, 250 se-
quences were resequenced, about one-fifth of the dataset, significantly 
reducing the number of odd phylogenetic placements. All sequences 
were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers MZ634561 - 
MZ635501 and MZ647717 - MZ647945 (see Table 1 in Hill et al., sub-
mitted for publication ). 
2.2. Phylogenetic analyses 
The five coding genes were aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm 
(Edgar, 2004 ) in Mesquite (Maddison and Maddison, 2019 ) after amino 
acid translation using TranslatorX (Abascal et al., 2010 ). Amino acid 
positions 14 – 21 of the ND4 sequence produced an ambiguous align -
ment and were removed before back-translation to nucleic acids for 
phylogenetic analysis. PartitionFinder2 (Lanfear et al., 2016 ) was used 
to simultaneously fit evolutionary models and data partitions by locus 
and codon. The best model was a 13 partition model identified by AIC 
score (Akaike Information Criterion; Akaike, 1974 ), (see Table 3 in Hill 
et al., submitted for publication ). Time-calibrated trees were recon -
structed using the timing of six geological events separating sister taxa: 
five from Rivera et al. (2017) with the addition of 25±10 MY for the 
docking of the EPCT dating the genus Paedophryne . The maximum 
likelihood (ML) tree was estimated using IQTREE (Nguyen et al., 2014 ). 
Nodal support was assessed using 2000 bootstrap replicates. The 
Bayesian inference (BI) tree was estimated using BEAST2 (Bouckaert 
et al., 2014 ). Two independent Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs were per-
formed for 100,000,000 generations and sampled every 10,000 gener -
ations. The phylogeny was co-estimated with associate divergence times 
using log-normal priors for the geological calibration points. Chain 
stationarity was assessed using Tracer v1.7.1 (Rambaut et al., 2018 ). 
The runs were combined using LogCombiner with a burn-in of 30% and 
the consensus tree was generated using TreeAnnotator (Drummond and 
Rambaut, 2007 ). Nodes were recognized as highly supported if BS 
support values ranged between ⩾90 and PP ⩾0.90. Moderately sup-
ported nodes possessed BS support of 80 ⩽x D90 and PP.8 ⩽x D.9. 
Weakly supported nodes had BS support of 70 ⩽x D80 and PP.7 ⩽x D.8. 
Nodes below D.70 PP and D70 BS support were considered 
unsupported. Cryptic diversity is increasingly recognized across anurans (Vieites 
et al., 2009; Padial et al., 2010 ) and known from this subfamily of frogs 
(Oliver et al., 2013 ). While the present study was designed as a phylo -
genetic analysis across the subfamily, we nevertheless checked for the 
possibility that samples in fact represent multiple distinct lineages. 
Oliver et al. (2013) tested a range of cutoffs and found that 3% mito-
chondrial divergence was effective in delineating distinct evolutionary 
lineages in the genus Mantophryne . This study used different mito-
chondrial markers, therefore we examined species pairs falling below 
cutoffs of 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, and 1% mitochondrial divergence for cor-
respondence with their phylogenetic (combined nuclear and mito-
chondrial) divergences. We used genetic divergence criteria to designate 
candidate species, but additional work is necessary to confirm these 
hypotheses. 
We pruned the phylogeny down to single representatives of each 
species at each site, resulting in a phylogeny with 218 taxa using the R 
package k|o!(Paradis et al., 2004 ), and used this tree in downstream 
analyses. 
2.3. Community analysis 
Because Asterophryinae have received little ecological study, we 
took an empirical approach to defining “communities ”. Over decades of 
research, field workers have set up camps at various distances to sample 
biodiversity (based on fieldwork described here and from previous ex-
peditions and recorded in the BPBM database). We analyzed the spatial 
clustering of collection sites and calculated the pairwise distance be-
tween each recorded GPS coordinate using the R package ro{nt��!
(Padgham and Sumner, 2021 ), and found that a cutoff of ⊃1 km was 
sufficient to separate all collection sites used by field workers. Our 
working definition of communities are therefore the collection of 
candidate species that live in those sites, and we compared the phylo -
genetic resolution between species within sites vs. between sites. We 
assessed the diversity of lifestyles contained in eighteen multispecies 
communities for which we have reasonably complete species sampling 
based on our own fieldwork or that of our close colleagues (see Table 1 
in Hill et al., submitted for publication ). 
2.4. Evolution of lifestyle 
For each species included in our phylogeny, we collected habitat use 
information. Five anuran lifestyle descriptors are recognized for Aster -
ophryinae based on the perch type noted during collection and their 
behavior (Zweifel and Tyler, 1983; Kohler and Günther, 2008 ): arboreal 
(found on tree trunks or tree canopy, F2 m above the ground), scansorial 
(shrubs 2 m above the ground), terrestrial (ground, on the forest floor or 
leaf litter), fossorial underground (underground in holes or burrows), 
and semi-aquatic (stream, associated with streams and will swim for 
escape). We assigned species to a lifestyle based on microhabitat type 
collected from our own fieldwork or from published work including field 
guides, species descriptions, and museum databases (Menzies, 2006 , see 
citations listed in Table 1 in Hill et al., submitted for publication ). 
We reconstructed maximum likelihood ancestral states for lifestyle 
using the R package rotro~! (Pennell et al., 2014 ). ML models for the 
evolution of lifestyle along the phylogeny were fit assuming that rates of 
evolutionary transition are equal (equal rates), different for each pair-
wise comparison (all rates different), and different but symmetric (i.e., 
the probability of arboreal to terrestrial transition the probability of 
terrestrial to arboreal; symmetric). The best fit model was identified 
using AICc (Akaike Information Criterion; Akaike, 1974 ) and used to 
generate 2000 stochastic mappings onto the phylogeny using SIMMAP 
(Bollback, 2006 ) in the R package |sÞ�{{w�! (Revell, 2012 ). A majority 
of nodes (excepting 10) were reconstructed with F70% support for a 
single lifestyle. The branches descending from these nodes were painted 
by this lifestyle. Where there is some support at the nodes for other al-
ternatives (the dominant state was D70%), pie charts indicate E.C. Hill et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 177 (2022) 107618
5proportional support. For the purpose of counting transitions, we 
assigned states to the 10 nodes that fell below the 70% threshold using 
majority rule (F50% support). 
2.5. Rate through time analysis 
We investigated the tempo of lineage diversification using a lineage- 
through-time (LTT) analysis (Nee et al., 1992 ) from the |sÞ�{{w�!
package (Revell, 2012 ). The γ-statistic describes the mean diversifica -
tion rate (Pybus and Harvey, 2000 ). A parameter value of zero repre -
sents a constant rate of diversification through time, while significant 
negative values (γ D0) indicate early diversification, and positive values 
(γ F0) indicate late diversification. 
Unless otherwise stated, all analyses were conducted in the R sta-
tistical computing environment (R Core Team, 2022 ). Phylogenetic plots 
were created using the R packages rr�~oo.! {�ms.!�~oot{ , and 
nÞ|wÞ~! (King and Butler, 2009; Wang et al., 2019; Yu, 2020; Wickham 
et al., 2021 ), and with a custom script based on modifications of {�ms . 
3.Results 
We assembled a 233 sample dataset (205 taxa) using three nuclear 
and two mitochondrial genes (GenBank accession numbers listed in 
Table 1 in Hill et al. (submitted for publication) . With the new primers, 
174 loci were added which were missing from Rivera et al. (2017) , as 
well as the addition of 74 samples. The matrix contains 2474 nt and is 
99% complete at the five loci, missing only 1 SIA, 2 BDNF, 5 CYTB and 7 
ND4 sequences. 
3.1. Increase in phylogenic support 
We obtained a consensus topology that was highly supported, 
whether reconstructed using Bayesian time-calibrated or Maximum 
Likelihood methods (Fig. 2). This phylogeny received substantially more 
highly supported nodes than previous studies (Rivera et al., 2017 ). Of 
the 236 nodes present in the tree, 84% of the nodes were highly sup-
ported with BS support values ⩾90 and PP ⩾0.90 (see full tree presented 
in Figure 1 of Hill et al., submitted for publication ); the phylogeny 
pruned to 218 species – one species per site is presented in Fig. 2). Five 
percent of the nodes were moderately supported (80 ⩽x D90 and PP.8 
⩽x D.9), and 6% were weakly supported (70 ⩽x D80 and PP.7 ⩽x D.8). 
Only 5% of the nodes are unsupported with BS support D70 and PP 
support D0.7. Along the backbone, nearly all of the nodes show some 
degree of support, with about half strongly supported (4 strong, 4 weak, 
2 unsupported). The weakly supported nodes occur in regions with 
increased rates of genera diversification. We also note there were two 
places in the tree with minor topological differences between the ML and 
BI phylogenies consisting of swapping the order of adjacent nodes with 
short branches (within Hylophorbus and Xenorhina ). These do not have 
any impact on the intergeneric relationships established within the 
phylogeny. 
3.2. Timing and rate of clade evolution 
Both ML and BI time-calibrated reconstructions estimate the age of 
Asterophryinae at ⊃20MY old (Fig. 2), roughly 5MY younger than the 
estimate by Rivera et al. (2017) . The genera have deep histories, origi-
nating early in the history of the clade, between 20 – 12 MYA (Fig. 3). 
We do see an early burst of diversification with many short branches 
near the base of the tree (Fig. 2), coincident with generic diversification 
and microhabitat use transitions, consistent with the pattern expected 
for an adaptive radiation. Early diversification is also supported by the 
shape of the lineage through time plot and the large and negative γ 
statistic (γ  5.174, P-value 2.29 ×10 7, Fig. 3). The more recent 
era between 10 MYA and the present was another time of substantial 
species accumulation with most genera diversifying extensively. 3.3. Cryptic species and sites 
Gene flow appears to be low, with nearly all samples phylogeneti -
cally distinct. Where we had multiple samples of nominal species from 
the same site, in each case these individuals were resolved as phyloge -
netically distinct with significant nodal support and short, significant 
branch lengths separating tips. Oliver et al. (2013) reported that 3% 
mitochondrial distance was effective in delineating species. In our 
pairwise analysis of mitochondrial divergence, samples separated by 
3–4% mitochondrial divergence shared a common ancestor 0.9–1.4 MY 
ago by combined nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenetic distance. Five 
pairs of samples separated by 2–3% mitochondrial divergence were 
similarly separated by 0.7–1.3 MY of phylogenetic distance. Samples 
below 2% mitochondrial divergence possessed short branch lengths, 
ranging from 0.1–0.6 MY. Therefore we found that species pairs which 
satisfy both criteria were reliably identified as distinct: F2% mito-
chondrial divergence and F0.7 MY of phylogenetic distance. 
A rough spatial cutoff of ⊃1.1 km worked well to describe distinct 
sites containing separate candidate species, providing a spatial scale 
similar to that produced by elevational variation of ⊃100 m, producing 
sites that correspond well with what field collectors labeled as “camps ” 
or collection sites. In general, taxa at distinct sites were also distinct 
candidate species. Only a handful of taxa were found to be truly 
distributed between sites that were over 1 km apart. These included 
candidate species shared between Mt. Gerebu and Mt. Obree region, a 
separation of ⊃34 km (Choerophryne gunnari , Hylophorbus cf. rufes-
cens.12 , and Mantophryne cf. lateralis.4 ). In the Bowutu mountains, 
Callulops personatus ranged to Mt. Shungol, a distance of ⊃69 km, and 
Hylophorbus cf. rufescens.5 ranged ⊃5 km from Cliffside camp to the 
Suzuki track site. Four Normanby Island species are separated by a 
phylogenetic distance of only about 200,000 years, producing little 
mitochondrial divergence. We considered these as the same species 
occurring across sites separated by ⊃10 km across a mountain range: 3 
species on Normanby Island shared between Mwatebu and Buyetai sites: 
Callulops doriae complex sp.1, Cophixalus desticans complex sp.1, and 
Hylophorbus cf. rufescens.6 ; one species (Mantophryne cf. lateralis.1 ) was 
shared between three sites: Mwatebu, Buyetai, and Sibonai. All 
remaining candidate species (⊃195) were unique at each site. 
3.4. Communities and their phylogenetic structure 
Our eighteen multi-species communities varied in number from two 
to 15 species (Fig. 4B). More than half of these have six or more species 
each. The members of each community span the phylogeny, generally 
with one species per genus, resulting in communities whose member 
species are typically not closely related to one another (Fig. 5). In the 
instances where there are two or more species per genus, most 
commonly they are Cophixalus or Choerophryne (Fig. 4C). Exceptions 
include the sites in the Torricelli mountains which have multiple Hylo-
phorbus , Austrochaperina , or Choerophryne . 
3.5. Evolution of lifestyle 
The best fit model for reconstructing the ancestral states for lifestyle 
assumed a symmetric transition rate matrix AICc SYM309, two points 
lower than the next best model: all rates different AICc ARD311 and 
nine points lower than the equal rates model: AICc EQR318. Lifestyles 
at internal nodes were reconstructed with very high support throughout 
the tree (the vast majority above 90% probability). The ancestor to 
Asterophryinae was inferred as terrestrial with 59% probability, and 
there is some support for arboreal with 35% probability (Fig. 2). Arbo-
real and scansorial lifestyles evolved within the first two MY after the 
genesis of the clade (by ⊃18 MYA; Fig. 2). The last two: semi-aquatic and 
fossorial lifestyles evolved shortly thereafter (by ⊃16 MYA). All life-
styles have repeatedly and independently evolved throughout the 
clade ’s history. E.C. Hill et al.

7Overall there is a pattern of niche conservatism: across the history of 
Asterophryinae, we found 33 transitions in lifestyle for 217 nodes 
(Fig. 2). Genera primarily have a single microhabitat association, but in 
some instances, secondary microhabitat transitions occur most notably 
within Asterophrys and Cophixalus . Many of these secondary transitions 
occur between ⊃15 MYA and the present day. 
4.Discussion 
Asterophryinae has long been recognized as an unusually speciose 
clade of frogs with diverse lifestyles (Zweifel and Tyler, 1983; Kohler 
and Günther, 2008; Rivera et al., 2017 ), however, the lack of phyloge -
netic resolution in the early-to-middle history of the group has pre-
vented further progress. Here, with 95% of nodes supported in the 
largest and most completely resolved phylogeny for Asterophryinae to 
date, our results show that this group arrived in New Guinea about 20 
MYA and rapidly diversified (Fig. 3) accompanied by early ecological 
diversification (Fig. 2), as expected for adaptive radiation (Schluter, 
2000 ). Below we discuss Asterophryinae communities, cryptic diversity 
and phylogenetic inference, and the taxonomic implications of this 
work. 
4.1. Asterophryinae communities 
One of the most distinctive, yet little-studied features of this group 
are their complex communities, in which adaptation has been assumed 
to play a key role. We describe here communities of up to 15 syntopic 
species of Asterophryinae. We found that the typical complex Astero -
phryinae community has six or more species from up to nine genera with 
representatives of up to five lifestyles: terrestrial, arboreal, fossorial, 
scansorial, and semi-aquatic (listed in order of frequency; Fig. 4). This 
level of within-community ecological diversity is unusual among 
amphibian adaptive radiations, which are reported to contain 2–3 spe-
cies in microsympatry which differ in body size (Thorius salamanders: 
Rovito et al., 2013b , Limnonectes fanged frogs: Setiadi et al., 2011 ), or in 
microhabitat association (Desmognathus salamanders: Kozak et al., 2005 , 
Kaloula microhylid frogs: Blackburn et al., 2013 ), and up to 4 species of 
Bolitoglossini salamanders (Wake, 1987 ). 
Ecological opportunity has contributed to Asterophryinae ’s diversification. Asterophryinae was the first frog lineage to colonize the 
growing New Guinea island in the Miocene, ⊃20 MYA. Based on our 
phylogeny, early diversification was rapid, with short branches along 
the backbone of the radiation confirmed by a highly significant gamma 
statistic (Figs. 2, 3). Within the first several million years of arrival to 
New Guinea, all five microhabitat types had evolved along with diver -
sification into half of the present-day genera. Microhabitat transitions 
within Asterophryinae often coincide with the evolution of new genera, 
followed generally by niche conservatism within most genera (Fig. 2), a 
pattern that is common to amphibian radiations (see citations above). 
Several genera provide exceptions to the general pattern, with multiple 
microhabitat transitions concentrated in: Cophixalus (terrestrial, scan-
sorial), Copiula (terrestrial, fossorial), Asterophrys (arboreal, terrestrial, 
and fossorial), and Choerophryne reported in Oliver et al. (2017) from 
taxa not included here. Undoubtedly there will be more discoveries 
made by continuing to complete the phylogeny. 
Our phylogenetic analysis shows that larger Asterophryinae com-
munities are built up by adding species of either terrestrial or scansorial 
forms, with as many as five terrestrial species and as many as six scan-
sorial species in the largest assemblages (Fig. 4). For the terrestrial 
forms, in nearly every case the additional species represent distinct 
genera (Fig. 4). For example, the Mwatebu site on Normanby Island has 
five species and five genera of terrestrial frogs (Figs. 4C, 5). In contrast, 
there are only two genera known to possess scansorial lifestyles, 
Cophixalus and Choerophryne , and thus at Cliffside camp there are six 
scansorial species from these two genera. Interestingly, there is gener -
ally only one arboreal species per site, from either Oreophryne A or 
Oreophryne B, which are possible to locate in the field through their calls. 
Furthermore, both Oreophryne A and B lineages co-occur at the locality 
level at nearby sites in the offshore islands of Normanby and Rossel, and 
on the mainland at Mt. Trafalgar on the EPCT. 
A remaining puzzle is how such complex communities of Aster -
ophyrinae are assembled. The patterns we find here are in contrast to 
iconic examples of adaptive radiation such as Anolis lizards, Darwin ’s 
Finches, and African haplochromine cichlids, which involves a founding 
species colonizing an environment followed by in situ diversification 
into available ecological niches (Losos et al., 1998; Schluter, 2000; 
Gillespie, 2004; Fine et al., 2005 ). Asteropryinae communities clearly do 
not evolve by de novo diversification following colonization, instead, we

Hill et al.

8find early diversification, niche conservatism, and migration, which 
implies community buildup by some process of assembly (Emerson and 
Gillespie, 2008 ). Lineages of Asterophryinae are characterized by low 
gene flow as even replicates of species at the same site are phylogenet -
ically distinct, and species, in general, are separated over small spatial 
scales, producing high endemism (see also Oliver et al., 2013; Oliver 
et al., 2017 ). Over evolutionary time scales, it appears that these line-
ages are undergoing a continual process of fragmentation and species 
accumulation (Fig. 3). As nearly all of our communities trace their most 
recent common ancestor to the base of the tree, there appears to be little 
phylogenetic structure within communities (Fig. 5). 
These patterns are a first description of the remarkable endemism 
and diversity of Asterophryinae. Clearly, more fieldwork spanning 
greater geographical coverage (for example, are there similarly complex 
communities in Western and Southern New Guinea?) is needed to gain a 
more complete assessment of and to understand the mechanisms pro-
ducing this exceptional diversity. 4.2. Cryptic diversity and phylogenetic inference 
Cryptic diversity is increasingly recognized as the dominant pattern 
across the tree of life (reviewed in: Bickford et al., 2007 ) and is a 
problem that affects many domains of biology including taxonomy, 
phylogenetics, conservation, and biodiversity studies. Of the 233 sam-
ples representing 205 taxa included in our phylogeny, only nine candi -
date species were found at more than one site (Fig. 2), demonstrating the 
overwhelming tendency toward narrow-range endemism in this sub-
family. Most geographically widespread “species ” were found to be 
complexes of distinct phylogenetic lineages, some of which were quite 
ancient. For example, lineages of the monotypic Genyophryne thomsoni 
diverged from their most recent common ancestor as long as 8 MY ago, 
and similarly so for Austrochaperina palmipes . Mantophryne lateralis and 
Hylophorbus rufescens were previously thought to be single species with 
very large geographic ranges, yet we found five lineages of the Manto -
phryne lateralis species complex and 18 candidate species of the Hylo-
phorbus rufescens species complex, some of whom share a common

Hill et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 177 (2022) 107618
9ancestor as long as 10 MY ago. All of these examples are morphologically 
cryptic species complexes. Several studies have found multiple cryptic 
species complexes within genera (Zweifel, 1979; Oliver et al., 2013; 
Oliver et al., 2017 ). Here, we found cryptic diversity in at least 12 
genera, within: Callulops doriae , Genyophryne thomsoni , Liophryne den-
tata, Copiula sp., Barygenys exsul, Austrochaperina palmipes , Choerophryne 
sp., Choerophryne darlingtoni , Aphantophryne pansa , Hylophorbus , Man-
tophryne , several lineages of Cophixalus , several lineages of Oreophryne A 
and B, and Paedophryne swiftorum . Our analyses clearly demonstrate that 
any widespread species of Asterophryinae should be considered suspect 
until verified. Especially when studying biodiversity in remote localities, 
the possibility of cryptic diversity should be considered when devel -
oping a sampling strategy to make the best use of limited time and 
resources. 
Until now, one mystery of this group is how we obtain so many 
widely-distributed species of diminutive frogs, often across sites sepa-
rated across the open ocean from the mainland of New Guinea to its 
satellite islands. The short answer is that they are not widely-distributed 
species. The vast majority of them have very small distributions (less 
than ⊃1 km), resulting in extremely high endemism. This pattern is 
reasonable given the ecological heterogeneity of New Guinea – separa -
tion of ⊃1 km often corresponds to sites at different elevations or hab-
itats. A point of debate in our own fieldwork was whether it was worth 
the investment in resources to obtain more samples of Hylophorbus 
rufescens , Mantophryne lateralis , Liophryne dentata , Austrochaperina pal-
mipies and other species across both mainland and island sites. We decided to sample specimens from every site. Had we not done so, we 
would have never discovered the extent of the ancient extensive cryptic 
diversity within Asterophryinae. 
Furthermore, by adding more representatives from “wide-spread 
species ”, portions of the tree topology which were previously ambiguous 
became stabilized. Whereas it was previously unclear where many 
genera fit into the larger phylogeny, their sister clade relationships are 
now clarified bringing resolution to previously intractable nodes 
(compare Rivera et al., 2017 , with Figure 2). As it turned out, with 
incomplete sampling, many formerly monotypic lineages tended to be at 
the end of long branches, which were broken up by adding geographic 
sampling. That the inclusion of multiple geographic samples of “species ” 
would stabilize the subfamily-level phylogeny was a surprising and 
serendipitous result. 
4.3. Asterophryinae phylogenetics 
It became clear early on in the biological exploration of New Guinea, 
that lineage diversity was low compared to adjacent parts of SE Asia and 
other tropical areas (Allison, 2009 ). This helped create an impression 
that species diversity was also low and this was seemingly confirmed by 
early workers. For example, Richard Zweifel ’s pioneering taxonomic 
work beginning in the 1950s on the thousands of frog specimens 
collected during the Archbold Expeditions demonstrated that many 
morphologically diagnosed species had fairly large geographic ranges 
(Zweifel, 1956; Zweifel, 1963; Zweifel, 1971 ). However, with the

munities are traced here, two on the mainland of New Guinea: Cliffside camp, Kamiali, Bowutu Mountains [site 30], and Maru Ruama, Mt. Gerebu [site 39]; and one 
on an offshore island: Mwatebu, Normanby Island [site 66]. Color codes indicating sites follow Fig. 4. E.C. Hill et al.

10development of portable sound recorders in the 1960s, it quickly became 
clear that many of these widespread taxa were actually composite spe-
cies, many of them range-restricted endemics (Nelson, 1973; Menzies 
and Tyler, 1977 ). Molecular work, including our findings reported 
herein, has shown that even frogs with similar calls (e.g., Genyophryne 
thomsoni ) are composite species, suggesting that frog species richness in 
New Guinea is exceptional. 
As a case in point, the semi-aquatic Austrochaperina palmipes does not 
call. Zweifel (2000) diagnosed Austrochaperina palmipes based on 
morphological similarities to other members of Austrochaperina however 
it has never allied with any other species of Austrochaperina in molecular 
phylogenetic treatments (Rittmeyer et al., 2012; Peloso et al., 2016; 
Rivera et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2018 ). Here we show that it is not a single 
species distributed across the mainland and offshore islands, but is 
actually a cryptic species complex. The fossorial species complex Gen-
yophryne thomsoni is monotypic and has a similar widespread distribu -
tion pattern. It produces simple one or two-note (low-information) calls, 
and only during heavy rains, providing limited opportunities for col-
lecting the large amounts of data required to discover any distinctions. 
Both of these have derived lifestyles with no clear morphological alli-
ance to other groups: Austrochaperina palmipes is an excellent swimmer 
among direct-developing terrestrial frogs, is able to climb seeps and 
waterfalls, and hops along stream rocks. Genyophryne thomsoni is 
fossorial with short muscular legs and disc-shaped bodies, seemingly 
well suited for a burrowing lifestyle. We showed that both A. palmipes 
and G. thomsoni are actually cryptic species complexes that originated at 
least ⊃8 Ma with G. thomsoni sister to the cryptic complex of Liophryne 
dentata , and A. palmipes is sister to a major clade including Austro -
chaperina A and B Barygenys Copiula Liophryne Genyophryne 
Xenorhina Asterophrys Callulops Mantophryne Hylophorbus . 
The earliest efforts in molecular phylogenetics of Asterophryinae 
used mitochondrial 12S and 16S loci (Kohler and Günther, 2008 ), which 
are efficient for diagnosing species, but nuclear genes are clearly 
required to find support for deeper nodes in this group (de Sa et al., 
2012 ) as well as across the Anuran tree of life (Feng et al., 2017 ). 
However, the mere inclusion of a few nuclear genes is not sufficient to 
find nodal support for taxa at the end of long branches, which require 
increased sampling to break up long branches. 
For the first time, we were able to clarify the intergeneric organi -
zation of Asterophryinae with strong support: establishing the mono -
phyly of most genera and the non-monophyly of the remaining genera, 
and clearly identifying their sister clade relationships, including the 
timing and order of diversification. This is a significant step forward 
from a previous paper by some of us where a little less than half of the 
nodes had some support, and importantly, most of the deeper nodes 
were not resolved including those along the backbone (Rivera et al., 
2017 ). In the current phylogeny, the problematic non-monophyletic 
genera Oreophryne and Austrochaperina are now clearly resolved into 2 
or 3 monophyletic clades, respectively, with clear placement relative to 
their sister taxa. 
We accomplished this nearly fully resolved tree partly by improve -
ments to the data. We added 74 tips to the tree bringing the total tips to 
233. The vast majority of these broaden geographic sampling, which we 
suspect helped to break up some of the long branches in the previous 
tree. We completed the dataset of loci sequenced for each sample (now 
99% complete) of our five-locus dataset. Given that our subfamily spans 
⊃20MY of evolution, it is important to select loci with mutation rates to 
inform the various depths of the tree, from slowly evolving nuclear (e.g. 
BDNF and SIA), moderately evolving nuclear (NXC1) to fast-evolving 
mitochondrial (e.g. CYTB and ND4). In particular, the ND4 dataset 
and to a lesser extent the NXC1 dataset had many holes in 2017; 
developing improved primers specific to Asterophryinae enabled the 
completion of the faster-evolving datasets that likely improved support 
and reduced odd placements. Improved data curation confirmed or 
replaced suspect data by reexamining locus-by-locus pairwise similarity 
matrices between taxa and re-sequencing any loci that were outliers. Finally, we reconstructed phylogenies with improved evolutionary 
models (partitioned by locus and condon and selected by Partition -
Finder2). Phylogenetic problems with more taxa are inherently more 
difficult to resolve. In groups such as Asterophryinae with a deeply 
nested history, a tendency toward fragmentation among morphologi -
cally cryptic lineages with known taxonomic issues, it is important to 
have a wide representation of samples across time and space to ensure 
that the broadest possible sampling of the diversity of the group is 
included. 
4.4. Taxonomic findings 
We are now closer to a phylogenetic taxonomy for the Astero -
phryinae. We recovered 16 monophyletic clades of Asterophryinae, 
leaving only the possible paraphyly of Liophryne and its relationship to 
Sphenophryne , Oxydactyla , and Genyophryne unclear and requiring 
further study. Our new recommendations include synonymization of the 
monotypic Oninia with Asterophrys , identifying Aphantophryne for 
further study, and finding strong support for dividing Oreophryne (and 
possibly Aphantophryne ) into two reciprocally monophyletic clades, and 
Austrochaperina into three reciprocally monophyletic clades (Fig. 1). Our 
primary additions are establishing the monophyly of previously un-
supported genera and establishing sister genera relationships with 
strong support, in addition to clarifying many taxa previously thought to 
be widespread species into phylogenetically distinct lineages (summa -
rized in Table 1). A full list of taxonomic recommendations is given in 
Table S1. 
The taxonomy of Asterophryinae has had a turbulent history over its 
long 120 years of study with numerous name changes and reversals, 
which are included here for workers new to this nomenclature while 
reviewing taxonomic changes for each genus-level clade. Astero -
phryinae, a subfamily of Microhylidae, was established by Albert

11Günther, 1858 , and for a time divided into Asterophryninae and Sphe-
nophryninae, and Asterophryninae and Genyophryninae by different 
workers, before being synonymized back to Asterophryinae (reviewed 
in: Frost, 2021 ). Inter-generic organization of Asterophryinae has been 
particularly enigmatic as evidenced by the multiple reorganizations of 
its ⊃21 genera over the last decades (Zweifel, 1956; Menzies and Tyler, 
1977; Zweifel and Allison, 1982; Burton, 1986; Zweifel and Parker, 
1989; Burton and Zweifel, 1995; Zweifel, 2000; van Bocxlaer et al., 
2006; Frost et al., 2006; Günther, 2009; Kraus, 2013; Peloso et al., 
2016 ). 
Dubois et al. (2021) proposed to reclassify 350taxa of Astero -
phryinae under a single genus: Asterophrys , citing some instances of 
unresolved polyphyly or paraphyly. We find that this does more harm 
than good. We find strong evidence for 16 monophyletic generic level 
clades, with only a few groups requiring further work (similar to the 
findings of: Rivera et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2018 , Table 1). In this study, we 
revealed most of the intergeneric relationships as well. Therefore, cat-
egorizing all Asterophryinae as a single genus Asterophrys would abolish 
all of this work over the past 120 years to uncover the structure of this 
diverse group and do nothing to clarify the taxonomy. We reject this 
proposal and will refer to our results with respect to the pre-Dubois et al. 
(2021) taxonomy. 
Asterophrys Tschudi, 1838. Rivera et al. (2017) established the 
monophyly of Asterophrys Metamagnusia Pseudocallulops and rec-
ommended their synonymization. Tu et al. (2018) additionally synon -
ymized the monotypic genus Oninia to the enlarged Asterophrys , 
suggesting the sister taxon relationship of Asterophrys and Xenorhina . 
Our study provides strong support for the monophyly of Asterophrys 
(including Metamagnusia Oninia Pseudocallulops ) and its sister 
relationship to Xenorhina . 
Aphantophryne Fry, 1917 is a terrestrial clade of three named species. 
Previous studies used only one specimen of Aphantophryne pansa 
resulting in an ambiguous placement within Asterophryinae (Kohler and 
Günther, 2008; de Sa et al., 2012; Tu et al., 2018 ). Rivera et al. (2017) 
included four specimens collected from a single site which were recov -
ered as a monophyletic clade. To these four we added two Aphanto -
phryne pansa specimens from different peaks of the Owen Stanley 
mountain range. Interestingly, these are phylogenetically distinct sug-
gesting that Aphantophryne is polyphyletic with BPBM 5299 nested 
within Oreophryne A, and with BPBM 8312 nested within Oreophryne B. 
While these nodes are strongly supported; they involve only one spec-
imen each. We recommend further study with the inclusion of more 
specimens. 
Austrochaperina Fry, 1912 is a terrestrial group with two semi- 
aquatic members. The polyphyly of Austrochaperina was suggested by 
several studies that recovered Austrochaperina species interdigitated 
with Copiula (Kohler and Günther, 2008; Pyron and Wiens, 2011; Ritt-
meyer et al., 2012 ). Later studies found a weak signal for possibly two 
clades of Austrochaperina , one sister to Copiula , separate from Austro -
chaperina palmipes but whose sister relationship was ambiguous (Rivera 
et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2018 ). Our results clearly show that Austro -
chaperina is polyphyletic with three well-supported and reciprocally 
monophyletic clades: Austrochaperina A is sister to Barygenys , while 
Austrochaperina B is sister to Copiula . The semi-aquatic Austrochaperina 
palmipes is not a single widely-distributed species, but rather a mono -
phyletic clade of species which are not related to Austrochaperina A nor 
B. Reclassification and further study of Austrochaperina is highly 
recommended. 
Barygenys Parker, 1936 is a fossorial group whose monophyly was 
confirmed by multiple molecular studies (Sumida et al., 2000; Frost 
et al., 2006; Kohler and Günther, 2008; Rittmeyer et al., 2012; Peloso 
et al., 2016 ). What was unknown was its sister relationship, which 
varied between Cophixalus, Genyophryne , and Paedophryne . We confirm 
strong support for the monophyly of Barygenys and find strong support 
for its sister relationship to Austrochaperina B. 
Callulops Boulenger (1888) is a fossorial group with a long history. Peters (1867) described a new species (of now Callulops ) and assigned it 
to Phrynomantis which has the same name as an African genus. Zweifel 
(1972) re-diagnosed Phrynomantis and assigned 15 species to it, 
including 5 new species. Species were named to both Phyrnomantis and 
Callulops until 1988, when Dubois, 1988 synonymized all Papuan 
Phrynomantis into Callulops , 121 years after its initial description. We 
confirmed the monophyly of Callulops and its sister relationship to 
Mantophryne Hylophorbus along with Günther et al. (2010), Rittmeyer 
et al. (2012), Peloso et al. (2016), Rivera et al. (2017) . 
Choerophryne Van Kampen, 1914 The formerly recognized genus 
Albericus was synonymized with Choerophryne based on molecular evi-
dence by Peloso et al. (2016) . We confirm strong support for the 
monophyly of Choerophryne along with previous studies (Peloso et al., 
2016; Rivera et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2018 ). 
Copiula M˘ehely, 1901 is a group with terrestrial and fossorial mem-
bers that has historically been difficult to resolve. Menzies and Tyler 
(1977) and Burton (1990) identified multiple morphological characters 
that distinguish Copiula from other Papuan microhylids: broad pre-
maxillae, enlarged rostral glands, large truncated digital disks, and the 
origin, course, and insertion of the deltoid. Molecular studies rejected 
monophyly (Kohler and Günther, 2008; Tu et al., 2018 ) or were 
inconclusive (Rivera et al., 2017 ). We found only two species that are 
not part of a monophyletic Copiula (in common with Rivera et al., 2017 ): 
Copiula tyleri is nested within Austrochaperina B with high support while 
Copiula sp.7 is nested within Cophixalus , again with high support. We 
visually examined the specimens and found that Copiula tyleri bears a 
strong resemblance to its sister taxon Austrochaperina B macrorhyncha , 
and the specimen of Copiula sp.7 is a very small individual and difficult 
to assign; both specimens should receive further study. With the 
exception of these two specimens, we found strong support for Copiula as 
a monophyletic clade that is sister to Austrochaperina B. 
Cophixalus Boettger, 1892 is a large group with terrestrial and 
scansorial members. Earlier studies concluded that Cophixalus is poly-
phyletic (Kohler and Günther, 2008; Pyron and Wiens, 2011; Rittmeyer 
et al., 2012 ), which was contradicted by Rivera et al. (2017) who found 
strong support for its monophyly pending the inclusion of Copiula sp. 7 
(BPBM 38939). Visual inspection of BPBM 38939 revealed a small 
specimen that is potentially a juvenile. As juvenile specimens are diffi-
cult to identify, we attributed the GenBank submissions for this spec-
imen as “Unidentified microhylid ”. Setting aside BPBM 38939, our 
analysis finds strong support for the monophyly of Cophixalus in 
agreement with Rivera et al. (2017) , and a strong sister relationship to 
Paedophryne . 
Genyophryne Parker, 1934 is a monotypic genus of fossorial frogs and 
was defined on the morphology of the pectoral girdle, maxillae, verte -
bral column, and tongue, but there has been debate regarding which 
genus it is most closely allied (Parker, 1934; Zweifel, 1971 ). Here we 
find that it is an old monophyletic species complex (⊃8 Ma) where 
geographically disparate sites contain phylogenetically distinct species 
nested within the clade (Liophryne Sphenophryne Oxydactyla ). We 
discuss these genera in the Liophryne section. 
Hylophorbus Macleay (1878) originally described a new genus that 
contained only one species, Hylophorbus rufescens , collected around the 
Binaturi River in southern New Guinea on an expedition to New Guinea 
from Australia in 1875 aboard the Chevert. A century later the genus 
was revisited by Zweifel (1972) who left Hylophorbus unchanged (but 
named two subspecies). It was not until Günther (2001) , nearly 130 
years after the original description, that the first non-rufescens Hylo-
phorbus was described, based in part on variation in call signatures and 
habitat. Currently, we still have a very widespread distribution of 
Hylophorbus rufescens with some researchers preferring to catalog sam-
ples as unnamed species, creating a rather confusing taxonomic situa-
tion. We confirm strong support for the monophyly of Hylophorbus and 
its sister relationship to Mantophryne , which has been strongly supported 
in previous molecular phylogenetic studies (Kohler and Günther, 2008; 
Rivera et al., 2017; Tu et al., 2018 ). We furthermore confirm the E.C. Hill et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 177 (2022) 107618
12existence of many ancient cryptic lineages and recommend that Hylo-
phorbus receive more study to clarify species within this monophyletic 
genus. 
Liophryne still requires further study as we cannot confidently 
confirm nor reject monophyly. Parker (1934) originally included Lio-
phryne as a member of the genus Sphenophryne based on the pectoral 
girdle having a complete complement of bony and cartilaginous ele-
ments; he otherwise noted that the members of Liophryne were diverse. 
Tyler and Menzies (1971) upon reanalysis established Sphenophryne as a 
genus based on the inclusion of the presence of a partly free tongue and 
procoelous vertebral column. Zweifel (2000) separated the clade into 3 
genera: Liophryne , Sphenophryne , and Oxydactyla , noting that his clas-
sifications may include morphological features that are homoplastic. 
Rivera et al. (2017) recovered a paraphyletic grouping of Liophryne that 
included Sphenophryne , Oxydactyla and Genyophryne and suggested 
further study due to weak support at some of the basal nodes of this 
grouping, which we confirm here. We also find that Liophryne dentata is 
not single species but a monophyletic species complex nested within the 
larger clade. We note, however, that some internal nodes near the base 
of this clade remain unsupported as did Rivera et al. (2017) and 
recommend further study with the inclusion of more taxa aimed to verify 
whether Liophryne Oxydactyla Genyophryne should be synonymized 
into Sphenophryne , or whether these genera can be recovered as separate 
monophyletic clades. 
Mantophryne Boulenger (1897) was described as a monotypic genus 
with the single terrestrial species Mantophryne lateralis . Zweifel (1972) 
reclassified Mantophryne as Phrynomantis . Mantophryne was resurrected 
in 1986 (Burton, 1986 ) and has remained a monotypic genus until the 
recent description of four named species, the discovery of cryptic di-
versity, and the synonymization of the monotypic Pherohapsis menziesi 
into Mantophryne (Oliver et al., 2013 ). We confirmed the monophyly of 
Mantophryne and its sister relationship to Hylophorbus along with (Oliver 
et al., 2013; Peloso et al., 2016; Rivera et al., 2017 ). 
Oreophryne Boettger (1895) is a large group of arboreal frogs with an 
extremely large distribution (throughout mainland New Guinea, 
offshore islands to the west, north, and east, and parts of South East 
Asia), whose monophyly has long been suspect. Several research groups, 
using different taxa, came to differing conclusions: Oreophryne basal to 
all remaining Asterophryinae (de Sa et al., 2012 ), or polyphyletic with a 
portion of it basal with other species scattered throughout the tree (Tu 
et al., 2018 ), whereas Rivera et al. (2017) suggested that Oreophryne 
may represent three clades. With the largest sampling of Oreophryne to 
date (44 taxa), we find strong support for two evolutionarily indepen -
dent clades which we denote A and B. We note tissues for the type 
species of Oreophryne , Oreophryne senckenbergiana (Boettger, 1895 ), 
were not available for this study, and therefore it is unclear which group 
should retain the name Oreophryne . However, it is clear that these are 
two reciprocally monophyletic groups. “Oreophryne A” is highly sup-
ported as the sister to the remainder of the subfamily, and has a large 
distribution extending from the EPCT and Eastern offshore islands 
westward through the Accreted Terranes. The unrelated younger 
“Oreophryne B” clade is restricted to the Southeastern tip of the EPCT and 
the Eastern offshore islands, but its precise sister taxon remains unclear 
with two possibilities: potentially sister to Cophixalus , or sister to all of 
the remaining clades excepting Oreophryne A, Paedophryne , and 
Cophixalus , Fig. 2). Interestingly, both clades appear in South East Asia: 
from Sulawesi - Oreophryne B variabilis and Oreophryne B sp.5, and from 
the Philippines - Oreophryne A anulata and Oreophryne A nana. As a 
historical note, species contained in Oreophryne A have been previously 
described as belonging to the following genera: Phrynixalus (Stejneger, 
1908; Taylor, 1920 ), Chaperina (Taylor, 1920 ), Sphenophryne (Bou-
lenger, 1896; Boulenger, 1898; M˘ehely, 1897 ), Hylella (Werner, 1989 ), 
Hyla (Barbour, 1912 ), Mehelyia (Wandolleck, 1910 ), and Phrynomantis 
(Noble, 1926 ), whereas we could find no synonyms for species of 
Oreophryne B. 
Despite the apparent confusion, the organization of “Oreophryne ” is now clarifying. The “Oreophryne ” species in de Sa et al. (2012), Peloso 
et al. (2016) and O. anulata in Tu et al. (2018) group with Oreophryne A, 
and the species in Rivera et al. (2017) condense into Oreophryne A or B. 
The Sulawesi and Philippine taxa share most recent common ancestors 
with New Guinean taxa ⊃8 – 10 MYA, nested within clades with much 
deeper histories, raising the possibility that the migration of Oreophryne 
A and B are coming from New Guinea to South Asia. Increasing sampling 
from South Asia and areas outside of New Guinea are needed to confirm 
their distribution and direction of dispersal. 
Paedophryne Kraus, 2010 is a miniaturized terrestrial group has been 
allied to at least three different genera (all with low support): mono -
phyletic and sister to Cophixalus (Rittmeyer et al., 2012 ), sister to 
Cophixalus with P. swiftorum nested within Choerophryne (Rivera et al., 
2017 ), and monophyletic and possibly allied to Oreophryne (Tu et al., 
2018 ). Paedophryne dekot is the only sample grouping outside of Pae-
dophryne and within Oreophryne A, and thus should be reexamined for 
possible misdiagnosis (but was not available at the time of this study). 
Here we corroborate the monophyly of Paedophryne (with the exclusion 
of Paedophryne dekot ) and find support for a sister relationship to 
Cophixalus (PP 0.75 and BS 93), the original proposal of Rittmeyer 
et al. (2012) . 
Xenorhina Peters, 1683 is a largely fossorial genus. Xenobatrachus was 
synonymized with Xenorhina by Frost et al. (2006) . This result is sup-
ported by both morphological (Allison and Kraus, 2000 ) and molecular 
characters (this study Frost et al., 2006; Rivera et al., 2017; Tu et al., 
2018 ). We confirm strong support for the monophyly of Xenorhina and 
its sister relationship to Asterophrys . 
4.5. Conclusions 
We reconstructed the most robust phylogeny of Papuan Astero -
phryinae to date that includes 205 taxa sampled from over 80 sites 
across both mainland New Guinea and the satellite islands. We also find 
support for the monophyly of 11 of the established genera; the 
remaining 7 genera have strong support for non-monophyly and we 
recommend taxonomic reclassification. Additionally, we found evidence 
for cryptic diversity in both monotypic genera and widespread species 
suggesting that the taxonomy of all “widespread taxa” should be 
reevaluated. The sampling of cryptic species substantially increased 
phylogenetic resolution by anchoring the deeper nodes within the to-
pology, breaking up long branches, and increasing nodal support glob-
ally. We described community composition of Asterophryinae for the 
first time and found that multispecies communities are common and 
comprised of four or five lifestyles represented by diverse genera. Our 
phylogenetic analysis shows that early, rapid diversification gave rise to 
numerous genera coincident with ecological evolution. As a result, we 
see that the explosive speciation found within Asterophyrinae is 
potentially due to the combination of early adaptive radiation, niche 
conservatism, and non-adaptive processes of community assembly.
